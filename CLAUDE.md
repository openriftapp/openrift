# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. For full project documentation, see `docs/`.

## Project Overview

OpenRift is a card collection browser for the Riftbound trading card game. It's a Turborepo monorepo with a React frontend (`apps/web`), a Hono API server (`apps/api`), and a shared types/logic package (`packages/shared`), backed by PostgreSQL. See `docs/architecture.md` for infrastructure details.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
bun dev:web          # Start the web app dev server (Vite)
bun dev:api          # Start the API server (Hono, needs DATABASE_URL)
bun dev              # Start all apps in dev mode

# Database
bun db:migrate       # Run migrations (reads DATABASE_URL from .env)
bun db:rollback      # Roll back the last migration
bun make-admin -- <email>  # Grant admin role to a user
docker exec openrift-db-1 psql -U openrift -c "SQL"  # Run a one-off query

# Build
bun run build        # Build all packages (Turbo, runs shared first)

# Lint & Format
bun lint             # Full lint (builds first, then oxlint + oxfmt)
bun lint:oxlint      # Run oxlint with --fix
bun lint:oxfmt       # Run oxfmt on apps/ and packages/

# Test coverage
bun run test:coverage   # Run all tests (unit + integration) with coverage, merge into coverage/lcov.info

# Single app/package
bun run --cwd apps/web dev
bun run --cwd packages/shared build
```

For dev setup, see `docs/development.md`. For deployment, see `docs/deployment.md`.

## Database Schema

**`docs/schema.sql`** contains the full current schema as a `pg_dump --schema-only` snapshot. **Read this file instead of replaying migration files** when you need to understand the database structure.

Regenerate after applying migrations:

```bash
docker exec openrift-db-1 pg_dump -U openrift --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges > docs/schema.sql
```

## Migrations

The database is shared across all worktrees. **Ask the user before running `bun db:migrate`** — another agent may be mid-migration or relying on the current schema.

After any migration is applied, regenerate the schema snapshot and include it in the same commit:

```bash
docker exec openrift-db-1 pg_dump -U openrift --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges > docs/schema.sql
```

## Conventions

- **React Compiler** is enabled — do not add `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo` in new code.
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits enforced by commitlint (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` enabled. Target is ES2024 — prefer modern APIs like `Map.groupBy()`, `Promise.withResolvers()`, `.toSorted()`, `.toReversed()`, `.at()` over hand-rolled equivalents.
- **Styling:** Tailwind utility classes with CSS variables for theming (light/dark). Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging.
- **Linting:** oxlint (primary) + oxfmt. Always lint before committing (`bun lint`). To suppress a rule, use `oxlint-disable` comments (not `eslint-disable`) with a reason: `// oxlint-disable-next-line rule/name -- reason`. When writing JSDoc (`/** */`) comments on functions, always include a `@returns` tag — oxlint enforces `jsdoc/require-returns`.
- **shadcn/ui components:** Components in `apps/web/src/components/ui/` are scaffolded from shadcn's `base-nova` style. Add new ones via `bunx shadcn@latest add <name>`. When customizing a scaffolded component, add a `// custom: <reason>` comment on every changed/added line. This makes it easy to re-scaffold and diff to re-apply customizations. Never modify scaffolded code without a comment.
- **Dependencies:** Always pin exact versions — no carets (`^`) or tildes (`~`). E.g. `"vitest": "4.0.18"`.
- **Tests:** Run with `bun run test` (turbo → vitest), **not** `bun test` (bun's built-in runner, skips vitest/jsdom config).
- `@/` alias in the web app maps to `apps/web/src/`

See `docs/contributing.md` for full conventions.

## Worktree Requirement

**You MUST enter a worktree before making ANY code changes.** Do not edit, write, or delete files in the main repo. The only exceptions are:

1. The user explicitly says "work in main" (or equivalent) in the current conversation.
2. The task is purely read-only (answering questions, reviewing code, running read-only commands).

If you are about to use Edit, Write, or Bash to modify a file and you are NOT in a worktree, **stop and enter a worktree first.** No exceptions. No "it's just a small change." No "there are no other agents running." Enter the worktree.

- **Worktree** — each worktree is a full, independent copy of the repo with no file conflicts.
- **Main repo** — only when the user explicitly says to work in main.

**Worktree setup:** run `ln -s /home/eiko/repos/openrift/.env .env && LEFTHOOK=0 bun install --frozen-lockfile` before doing anything else.

**Worktree rules:** Database is shared (see Migrations). Use `docker exec` for DB access, not `docker compose`. Use a different port if you need a dev server (`PORT=5174 bun dev:web`). Never `git stash` or discard changes in the main repo.

**When done:** run `/done` to commit remaining work, add changelog entries, and run `bun run check`. Do not push or create PRs. The user will run `/merge` from main to squash-merge your branch.

## Changelog

`apps/web/src/CHANGELOG.md` is shown to users in the "What's new" panel. After completing `feat:` or `fix:` work, you MUST add an entry there (unless it's a chore/refactor that users won't notice or already has an entry). This helps us communicate improvements to users and track changes over time.

**Format:**

```plaintext
## YYYY-MM-DD

- feat: Short description in plain language — what it does for the user
- fix: Short description of what was broken and is now fixed
```

**Tone:** Natural and direct. No jargon. Short enough to scan. E.g.:

- `feat: Cards are grouped by set, with the set name staying visible as you scroll`
- `fix: App updates now show up faster on iOS`

It must always read as a proper sentence, not a fragment. Avoid starting with "Added" or "Added the ability to" — just say what the feature does for the user. For fixes, briefly describe what was broken and how it's now fixed.

Group multiple entries under the same date. Add new entries at the top, no matter the type. Don't add entries for: chore, refactor, perf, ci, docs, or internal fixes that users won't notice.
