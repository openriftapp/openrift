/**
 * Adds submitter attribution to `candidate_cards` for in-app user submissions
 * (ADR-036).
 *
 * User submissions flow into the same candidate pipeline as admin-uploaded
 * sources under `provider = 'usersubmission'`. These two columns record who
 * sent a candidate and their free-text note, so the admin can attribute a
 * submission, throttle a user (per-user daily cap counts rows here), and ban an
 * abuser. Both are nullable: candidates ingested from other providers have no
 * submitter.
 *
 * `submitted_by_user_id` references `users(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` so
 * deleting a user leaves their pending candidates in the review queue rather
 * than cascading them away. It is TEXT to match `users.id` (better-auth stores
 * ids as text, not uuid), and indexed for the per-user daily-cap count.
 *
 * @returns Resolves once the columns, FK, index and CHECK are in place.
