/**
 * Detach the host from a tournament instead of erasing the event when the
 * host account (or host organization) is deleted.
 *
 * Both host FKs were `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so a solo host deleting their
 * account from the profile danger zone silently erased every tournament they
 * hosted — rounds, pods, deck checks, and all participants' results — for
 * everyone who played in them. The org path had the same hole one hop out:
 * deleting a user cascades their owned organizations, which cascaded the
 * org-hosted tournaments.
 *
 * Now both FKs are `ON DELETE SET NULL` and `chk_tournaments_host` no longer
 * requires the same-side host id to be present: a `host_type = 'user'` row
 * with a NULL `host_user_id` reads as "deleted host" (the public route
 * already renders the "Host" fallback for it). The cross-side column staying
 * NULL is still enforced.
 *
 * @returns Resolves once the FKs and CHECK are swapped.
