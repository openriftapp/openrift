/**
 * Keep a renamed friend group reachable under its old slug.
 *
 * `/groups/$slug` URLs are bookmarked and embedded in trade emails that stay
 * valid for 7 days, but a slug rename used to 404 all of them immediately.
 * `previous_slug` records the slug a group last renamed away from; the
 * viewer-facing lookups fall back to it (current slugs always win) and the
 * web routes then redirect to the canonical slug. Only the most recent old
 * slug is kept — a second rename overwrites the alias.
 *
 * @returns Resolves once the column, CHECK, and partial index exist.
