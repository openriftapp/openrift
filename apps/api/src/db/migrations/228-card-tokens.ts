/**
 * `card_tokens`: which token cards a card tells the player to create.
 *
 * Derived from EN rules text (see `findTokenReferences` in the shared package)
 * because that is the only language whose phrasing we parse. Storing the result
 * as a card-id pair is what makes it language-neutral: every language then
 * renders the token through its own printings.
 *
 * `source` distinguishes derived rows, which the recompute replaces wholesale,
 * from manual ones, which it leaves alone.
 *
 * `mv_card_aggregates` gains `token_card_ids` next to domains/super_types/types
 * so the catalog read path picks it up without another join. The recompute must
 * run before the view refresh, or the view carries the previous derivation.
