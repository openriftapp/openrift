 * Ingest one signed-in user's decklist submission to the meta archive.
 *
 * A submission is an overlay, never a source mirror. A re-fetch replaces a
 * mirrored event's whole field (`replaceStandings`), so a contribution written
 * there would be wiped by the next recheck. Overlays are keyed per submission
 * and only review touches them.
 *
 * `chk_meta_event_player_overlays_target` permits exactly one anchor, which is
 * what shapes the two cases:
 *
 *   - Against an event the archive already has, the player overlay anchors on
 *     that live event and no event overlay is created.
 *   - Proposing an event the archive lacks, the player overlay anchors on an
 *     event overlay carrying the fields the person typed. Accepting that mints
 *     the live event and adopts the entries hanging off it, so both are
 *     reviewed as one thing.
