# Changelog

## 2026-09-12

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **A clearer stats band** — turn-1 and curve-out odds sit in their own row at the top, chart titles read at a glance, and Types, Rarity and Collection is a single switch instead of a row of mixed chart headers.
- feat(Groups): **A friendlier overview** — recent activity groups by day under a gold rail, the shared items, shop events and upcoming tournaments lists share a "Show all" link and one column width, and the banner hero no longer overlaps its own content or crowds the member avatars on a phone.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **A new variant takes the lead** — creating a variant makes it the one the deck list shows for that family, and it joins the same folders as the deck it was copied from.
- feat(Tournaments): **Standings that read like the archive** — a completed tournament opens with a champion plate (name, record, Legend and its art), Legends everywhere show as champion and title with their domain runes and link to the card, every standings row carries a round-by-round win/loss strip, a "Best finish per Legend" row of tiles (with how many players brought each Legend) sits above the final table, the pairings cards name each player's Legend, and spectators see the top cut as a compact bracket instead of the organizer's entry cards.
- feat(Tournaments): **Hand-edit the groups and the top cut** — before the first group match is played, organizers can swap players between seats within or across groups (the seat order sets who plays whom in which round), and while a cut round is open with no result they can drag players between its bracket slots; slot order and the path to the final stay fixed.
- feat(Tournaments): **Standings after any round** — the standings page has a round picker that shows the table as it stood after an earlier round (for a group stage: the group tables, seeds and bracket at that point), with a clear notice and a one-click way back to the latest table; the overview's round list links straight to each round's standings.
- fix(Tournaments): **The tournament header lines up with its content** — the hero band was one page gutter wider than the tabs below it.
- fix(Tournaments): **The cut decides the final placings** — a finished group stage tournament now ranks its champion, the finalist and every eliminated player by the bracket (losers of the same round by seed), with everyone who missed the cut following in qualification order, and shows a compact bracket of the cut and the full final standings table under the podium.
- fix(Tournaments): **Group rounds stay open to corrections** — in a group stage, earlier rounds now fold out under the current pairings with their full results, and organizers can still correct a result there until the top cut is generated. Legends in the group standings and meta-share picker now show the full name ("Jinx, Loose Cannon") instead of only the epithet.
- feat(Decks): **The next variant has a place in the tree** — the add-variant button now shows as the next slot in the branch graph instead of floating outside it, and the separate Variants button by the graph is gone (the same list is one tap away from the ⋮ menu).
- feat(Meta): **Player pages open on their whole career** — a player's page in the Meta Archive now defaults to all time instead of the current set, so their record doesn't look empty until you clear the era.
- feat(Meta): **One link instead of a toggle** — a legend's or player's Best/All finishes and a legend's archived decklists now expand with a single "Show all" link next to the heading.
- feat(Collection): **The scan sheet opens itself** — a card the scanner cannot place now brings up "Which card is this?" by itself, and that sheet can search the whole catalog when none of its guesses fit.
- fix(Groups): **Trade suggestion rows fold and preview like the rest of the app** — a suggestion with several variants now expands from anywhere on its row, not just the card name, uses the same card art as other trade rows, and hovering shows the card preview on whichever side of the screen has room instead of always covering the Offer button.
- fix(Collection): **Scanned rows name their printing** — picking another printing for a scanned card now shows on the row, which used to keep reading "Standard" for a different language, promo or signed copy.
- fix(Collection): **The missing-photo nudge names the cards** — it lists the first few by name, each linking straight to that card's photo upload page.
- feat(Account): **Pick a display language** — a new Display language setting on your profile switches the interface between English, Deutsch and Français; translation covers the site footer, the navigation, the command palette, sign-in and sign-up, the card browser with card, set, product and promo pages, collections and lists, decks, the pack opener, the rules pages and glossary, groups, trades and loans, the whole profile page, the card scanner, the contribute pages, the card designer, the match tracker and the Cardmarket extension pages so far and will expand page by page.

## 2026-09-11

### Highlights

- feat(Account): **A real profile behind your share link** — your public lists page now opens with your name, a bio, when you started and a Contributor badge, counts your contributions, tournaments and decks, shows signed-in visitors how many cards overlap with their own lists, and previews the art on every list. A new Public profile section in settings holds the bio and what else to show.
- feat(Groups): **A banner for your group** — admins can upload a picture, drag it to frame it, and it shows above the group's name and in the groups list.

### Other

- feat(App): **Quieter text, narrower forms, labelled icons** — status messages now sit in proper notice boxes instead of red or green sentences, settings fields stop stretching across the page, every inline link looks the same, icon-only buttons explain themselves on hover, and buttons in dark mode use darker text on their fill.
- feat(App): **More room around everything** — pages get a wider side margin on tablets and desktops, menus, selects and tabs have roomier rows, tables, lists and accordions drop the lines between rows, dialog and card footers lose their grey band, numbers sit on the same baseline as their labels, and the dividers and boxes that used to split sections on the card page, the deck editor, the meta archive, tournaments, groups, help articles and the rules browser are replaced by spacing.
- feat(App): **Fewer boxes on every page** — settings pages, lists, standings and stats now use headings and spacing instead of stacked bordered cards, so pages read lighter and rows line up with their headings.
- feat(App): **Share links turn off instead of rotating** — group invites, tournament sign-up links and the OBS browser source link now have a single Disable control, and the confirmation says that turning the link back on hands out a different one.
- feat(App): **A link to Cardmarket beside every wants list** — the export dialogs for collections, lists, decks and group trades that copy cards in Cardmarket's format now have an Open Cardmarket button that takes you straight to your want lists.
- feat(App): **One look for filters and fields** — search boxes, filter chips and view switches now share one fill, so an active filter no longer looks like one you are hovering.
- fix(Cards): **Photos you send in now count as applied** — a photo suggestion that we used showed up as "Already correct" on your submissions instead of "Applied", and did not count towards your applied total. Submissions reviewed before today have been corrected by hand.
- fix(Collection): **The missing photo nudge comes back for new cards** — dismissing the note about cards with no photo used to hide it for good; it now stays hidden only for the cards you dismissed it on and returns when you add another card the catalogue has no photo of. The note is a callout again and asks you to snap the cards.

## 2026-09-10

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Pick cards on Cardmarket for a list** — the browser extension now puts a + and − on every card on a seller's offers, and the popup sends your picks to OpenRift as an organize list you can share with the seller.
- feat(Collection): **One export dialog everywhere** — collections, wishlists, tradelists and organize lists now offer the same export formats plus a plain text list, and a collection export can follow the filters on screen.

### Other

- feat(Groups): **One share dialog, reworked** — lists, collections, decks and tier lists now share a link with the group controls right below it, then text, image, QR and print as tabs; stopping a share link now confirms first, since it can't be undone.
- feat(Collection): **A clearer extension popup** — the popup now opens with the OpenRift logo and splits into sections for Cardmarket, your picks and deck import, each shown only when it has something in it. Cardmarket lists the wishlists it synchronized with how many entries each holds and when the last sync was, and Deck Import only appears when there really is a decklist on the page, named.
- fix(Collection): **Tradelist exports keep card details** — a tradelist CSV now fills each copy's condition, grading and notes instead of leaving those columns blank.
- fix(Collection): **All-cards export matches the grid** — exporting All cards no longer includes copies held in a friend group's collection.
- fix(App): **Fixed an occasional crash right after loading a signed-in page** — a page could show an error screen instead of loading if it rendered before your session had finished loading; it now waits and loads normally.

## 2026-09-09

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **A new front door for contributing** — the Contribute page opens with what the catalogue needs and why, shows the cards you own that have no photo as tiles, explains each of the four ways to help and what you need for it, and keeps a count of your submissions waiting for review and applied. Each of the four now opens with the same look, and picking a card to fix gets its own page instead of a picker on a tile.
- feat(Meta): **Live standings while an event runs** — a running event now says so on its page and in the list, its standings and pairings arrive round by round with the round they stand after, and the page refreshes itself until the final sheet lands.
- feat(Cards): **Contribute in smaller steps** — the contribute page now asks what you want to add first, and each form opens with just the fields it needs.
- feat(Cards): **The preview card is the map of the form** — every spot the card shows is marked on the preview, and picking one jumps to the field that fills it.
- feat(Tournaments): **Group stage with a top cut** — a new format seats players in groups of four for three rounds, lets each group start its own next round, then seeds a fixed Top 4, 8 or 16 bracket from group placement.
- feat(App): **First-visit guides for lists, tier lists and the Stage** — a dismissable guide on a wishlist or tradelist, the tier list builder and the Stage explains what the page does and how to start, as collections and decks already had.
- feat(Trades): **See who you could trade with** — the Trades page now has a Could trade section for people you share matching wishlists and tradelists with but haven't traded yet.
- feat(Cards): **Upload a photo for a missing card image** — the suggest-image page now takes a photo straight from your phone or a file, no image host needed, and shows the rest of your cards without a photo so you can pick the next one.
- feat(Collection): **Your cards without a photo** — a nudge on your collection, a tile on Stats and a list on Contribute point at the cards you own that the catalogue has no picture for.
- feat(Groups): **Upcoming events at your local shops** — link the stores your group plays at and the group gets a Shop events page with the next two weeks of Riftbound events at each of them, filterable by current, past or all.
- feat(Collection): **Wishlist counts on Cardmarket** — the browser extension now marks each card on a seller's offers with how many you own, how many you still want, and your own reference price.

### Other

- feat(App): **Help and Contribute split apart in the header** — the header's Feedback button is now Help (articles, What's new, bug reports, Discord) next to a separate Contribute button for card data and supporting the site.
- feat(Cards): **Set filled in from the printed code** — a code like OGN-066/298 names its own set, so the picker only appears when the set is new to us.
- feat(Cards): **Correct a single printing** — a fix to one printing now opens that printing on its own, with the card's own details shown as a summary.
- feat(App): **Empty pages say what they're for** — Tournaments, Lending, Activity, trade sheets, group pages, tier lists, the deck comparison and the submission pages now explain the feature and the first step in place of a bare "nothing yet".
- feat(Cards): **"No image yet" filter** — the card browser and your collection can now show only printings without a picture.
- fix(Cards): **Contribute form rejected repeat card names** — submitting a card whose name someone had already sent in failed with a server error; now everyone's submissions for that name are kept.
- fix(Cards): **Image suggestions need a photo or a link** — the suggest-image form let you submit with neither; it now asks for one before you can send it.
- fix(Collection): **Share links open the full view when you already have access** — a collection share link used to show a read-only page with a small link to switch, which people missed; it now sends you straight to the editable view.
- fix(Groups): **A big trade no longer buries the activity feed** — a bulk trade of many cards used to fill the whole Recent activity window as separate rows, pushing out joins, shares, and other trades; it now counts as the one row it renders.

## 2026-09-08

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **A Trades page in the menu** — More → Organize → Trades lists everyone you're trading with across all your groups, people waiting on you first, one click from their trade sheet.
- feat(Collection): **One menu for collections and lists** — collections, wishlists and tradelists now share the same top bar and three-dot menu, with Scan, Quick add and Share always in the bar and Edit, Import, Export and Delete in the menu.
- feat(Collection): **Export any collection** — the three-dot menu on a collection now opens an export dialog with CSV formats and a Cardmarket wants list, which tradelists also gained.
- fix(Trades): **Menu badge counts people, not cards** — the trade badge used to show one per card in flight, so a nine-card swap read as nine; it now counts the people waiting on you, and the Groups badge only counts join requests.

### Other

- feat(Lists): **Trade chip on a wishlist row links to the trade** — a Reserved/Requested/Offered chip on a list entry now opens the trade sheet with whoever holds it, or a picker when more than one person does.
- feat(App): **Landing page says what OpenRift does** — the hero now opens with the job: track your collection, build decks, and trade with friends.
- feat(Cards): **Marketplace icon on card grid prices** — the price shown on each card in a grid now carries the icon of the marketplace it came from.
- feat(Collection): **Import from the collection page** — Import in the three-dot menu opens a paste-or-upload dialog and lands on the preview with that collection preselected.
- feat(Groups): **Binder sheet and group visibility in Share** — the share dialog now carries a Print tab for the binder sheet and, on lists, the friend-group visibility controls.
- feat(Collection): **Deck-building availability in Edit** — the include/exclude toggle moved from the collection menu into the Edit dialog.
- feat(Cards): **A readable link for each printing** — picking a printing on a card page now names it in the address bar, so a shared link opens on that exact printing instead of carrying an id.
- fix(App): **Mobile menu scrolls and folds** — the mobile navigation menu no longer clips off-screen on tall menus, and the Play, Organize, Create and Explore sections now collapse behind their heading, folded by default.
- fix(Cards): **Contribute form field labels** — every field on the contribute form now carries its label for screen readers and focuses when the label is clicked.
- fix(App): **Number fields can be cleared while typing** — quantity fields in dynamic list rules, deck swaps, the pack opener, the match tracker, and trade preferences no longer snap back to the old value the moment you backspace to empty.

## 2026-09-07

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **One scan list, one add step** — the scanner now keeps a list on the device and adds it to a collection in one step, so a reload or a lost request can no longer drop scanned cards.

### Other

- fix(Scan): **One look for the scan page on phones** — the scan page now uses the same full-screen layout before and after starting the camera, instead of switching between two different designs, with a simpler loading screen and a guide frame sized to match the live camera view.
- fix(Scan): **Clearer foil correction while scanning** — the scan tray no longer shows a normal card's finish button labeled as foil; switch a card's finish through the printing picker, which now marks the printing you're already on.
- fix(App): **No more flashed negative counts on the landing page** — under a slow first frame, the animated cards/printings/copies line could briefly read "-1 cards" before settling on the real numbers.
- fix(Scan): **Steadier scan viewfinder** — the outline no longer jumps around and flickers between grey and yellow while aiming; it now stays still and lights up green only once a card is actually read.

## 2026-09-06

### Other

- fix(Collection): **Readable quick-add selected rows** — some color schemes painted the selected row's text the same shade as its own background in the collection and deck quick-add search.

## 2026-09-05

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Loans and trades on the card detail** — opening a card now says which copies you lent out and to whom, which you borrowed and from whom, and what a live trade has promised away or is bringing in.

## 2026-09-04

### Highlights

- feat(Meta): **Round-by-round player runs** — each standings row on an event with pairings on file opens the player's run: every round with the opponent, their legend and final finish, and the game score.
- feat(Meta): **Best finish per legend** — an event page now lists each legend's highest-placed pilot above the standings, shows a result strip per row, and states the best-of and the record at the cut line in the header.
- feat(Meta): **Archived decks as a sortable list** — the deck browser opens on Premier and Competitive lists from the current era as rows you can sort by finish, date, value or what completing them costs you, with a grid layout one click away and the same filter bar as the rest of the archive.
- feat(Meta): **Archived decklists lead with the result** — the header now states the finish against the field, the player and the legend, and drops the generated deck name.
- feat(Decks): **Save, print and export a shared deck** — shared and archived decklists get an overflow menu holding the deck image, the printable sheet, the exports and the deck code.
- fix(Meta): **Faster standings for big events** — the full field now scrolls smoothly instead of freezing on "Show all".
- fix(Meta): **Archive pages open from a direct link** — the deck browser, legend pages and player pages came back blank when opened from a bookmark or a shared link; they now load.
- fix(Meta): **Submissions page opens from a direct link** — your sent-decklists page came back blank the same way; it now loads too.
- fix(Meta): **Accepted decklists show as accepted** — a decklist an admin approved kept reading "Waiting for review" and its submitter went uncredited; both now update once it's accepted.
- fix(Cards): **Promo pages open from a direct link** — a promo language page came back blank when opened from a bookmark or a shared link; it now loads.

### Other

- feat(Deck): **"Show every copy" leaves runes stacked** — a nested toggle now lets the rune stacks join the rest of the deck's expanded copies, instead of every rune always splitting out.
- fix(Meta): **Partial lists show the legend alone** — an archived list without a known champion no longer draws an empty dashed champion slot next to the legend.
- fix(Meta): **Archived decklists share correctly** — a link to one previewed the archive account and a generated deck name, and now shows the legend, the player and the finish.
- fix(Decks): **One name for copying a deck** — the archive called it "Fork to my decks" where the share page called the same action "Copy to my decks", and both now say copy.
- fix(Meta): **Legends index rank column** — the rank column no longer clips ordinals like "11th" or "288th", and the legend and best-finish columns split the remaining width so neither crowds the other.
- fix(Meta): **Decklist submissions no longer error** — submitting a list against an existing event failed with a server error every time; it now saves.
- feat(App): **Card-border accents** — headings, the footer, and the card detail text box now carry a gold rule and border motif drawn from the printed card's own edge, and the floating set header while scrolling the card browser no longer overlaps the header it is replacing.
- fix(Cards): **Special versions no longer count as standard printings** — showcase prints, oversized battlefields, and unfoiled duplicates of foil cards were treated as the plain version, so a standard-printings list rule could pull in a card on its showcase price.
- fix(Lists): **Clearing a rule filter no longer removes it** — emptying a price bound, the search box, or a multi-select's last option to type a new value dropped that filter row from a dynamic rule; it now stays until you remove it.
- fix(Meta): **Store and Casual merge into Local** — the two tiers held the same events under different names, so they're now one Local tier, and a large field run under a generic template is filed as Competitive instead.

## 2026-09-03

### Highlights

- feat(Meta): **Player pages** — every player name in the archive now opens a page with their record: event wins, top 8 finishes, the legends they brought, every archived finish with a Best/All view, and the decklists they registered, all narrowable with the scope bar.
- feat(App): **One palette everywhere** — dark mode panels, menus and borders now carry the navy tint instead of gray, and status colors, badges, callouts and hover states share one set of shapes and tones across the app.
- feat(Meta): **Decklists open as a card strip** — an expanded standings row now shows the whole list as card art sorted by energy, with the sideboard beside it, and every card opens its details.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Overnumbered as its own filter** — a card past its set's printed total is now filtered and labelled separately from its artwork, so an alt art that is also overnumbered reads as both.
- feat(Collection): **Overnumbered column in exports** — the collection CSV now carries the flag in its own column, and older exports that named it as an art variant still import.
- feat(Meta): **Filter standings by legend** — a legend filter sits next to the player search once a field has more than one legend on file.
- feat(Meta): **Deck value in the standings** — each archived list shows what it is worth at your marketplace and, signed in, what completing it from your collection costs; a Cost filter narrows the field by value or by what a list costs you to complete, and the record sits under the rank with the legend art leading the row.
- fix(Meta): **Consistent legend art** — a legend with no image on file now shows the same domain-tinted placeholder everywhere in the archive, instead of a plain grey square on the front page and event index. Standings and podium rows also drop their legend and decklist columns entirely for events the source published as bare placings, rather than filling every row with an empty placeholder.
- fix(Meta): **Consistent event blocks with a crowned winner** — Premier and Competitive events now share Store & Casual's layout, add a fanned podium of the winning legends, and mark first place with a crown instead of a gold "1".
- fix(Meta): **"Browse all" links show the full count** — tier and event-index links from the front page no longer land on a narrower scope than the count they promised.
- fix(Meta): **Deck preview drops repeated details** — the expanded decklist no longer repeats the player, legend, and partial-list badge already on the row above it, showing the chosen champion in their place.
- fix(Meta): **Correct completeness marking for playset champions** — a decklist whose champion arrived as a multi-copy line was wrongly marked partial, and now reads correctly.
- fix(Meta): **Deck names no longer end in an empty pair** — a list promoted from a user-id-keyed standing could be named "Legend, Title ()"; it now resolves the player's real name.
- fix(App): **Page bars reach the screen edge on wide monitors** — the title bar under the header no longer stops short of the viewport at the wide layout breakpoints, leaving a mismatched band on either side.
- fix(App): **Selected view toggles show as selected in dark mode** — the view and layout toggles (grid/list, docked panel, and similar) had lost their pressed highlight against the surrounding background.

## 2026-09-02

### Highlights

- feat(Meta): **Archived decks grouped by event** — the deck browser now lists each event's best lists newest first, with every list's value, what completing it costs you, and a cost filter.
- feat(Meta): **Slimmer decklist submission** — adding a list from a standings row shows the tournament and player as read-only, reads the paste as you type, and works out whole deck vs main deck only from the cards.
- feat(Meta): **Upcoming events in their own list** — the front page's tier sections now show only events with results, and everything still to come sits in a "Coming up" list beside them, soonest first.
- feat(Meta): **Event pages redesigned** — the header now shows the champion, format, and structure at a glance, and standings expand inline to preview each decklist's card mix, value, and how much of it you own.

### Other

- fix(Groups): **Removing cards from a group box** — a card held in two versions ignored the minus button and showed zeroes in its variant menu, which now counts the group's copies.
- fix(Groups): **Group settings check before saving** — the name and web address are now validated on the form, so a bad address says what is wrong on the field instead of failing with a generic error.
- fix(Account): **Failed requests now say so** — signing in or out, email codes, password resets, connected accounts, and import file reads report a network failure instead of doing nothing or spinning forever.
- feat(Meta): **Standings rows open on click** — clicking anywhere on a standings row opens its decklist, and every row now carries its legend art, not just the top cut.
- fix(Meta): **Archive fits on phones** — the tournament name moved into the event header, where the top bar had truncated it away, and the winner tile and podium rows now use the full width.
- fix(Meta): **Placements across the whole cut** — every seat in an event's top cut now carries its finishing place, where only the champion's showed before.
- fix(Meta): **Contribute prompt names the event** — the ask below the standings used the venue's street address, and now reads "Were you at (event name)?".
- fix(Meta): **Event page layout polish** — the country flag stays with the first line of a wrapping venue name, the entry filter matches the search field height, and the expanded decklist drops its nested box and stretched art.
- fix(Meta): **Widening the archive past its defaults** — picking "All time" in the era picker snapped back to the current set, and turning off the constructed filter on the decks page snapped back to constructed.

## 2026-09-01

### Highlights

- feat(Meta): **Tiered tournament overview** — the archive front page now groups events by tier: premier events carry the winner's legend art, and premier and competitive events list their top 3 finishes.
- feat(Meta): **Legends index shows each record** — every legend now carries its best finish, event wins, decklists and finishes, recomputed for whatever era, format, tier or country you pick, and the columns sort.

### Other

- feat(Meta): **Fresh in the archive** — a new front-page section lists what landed lately: new events on record, decklist batches, and standings.
- feat(Meta): **The archive opens on the current set** — every archive page now starts on the current set and constructed play, with all time and the other formats still one click away.
- feat(Meta): **Roomier archive filter bar** — search leads the row like everywhere else, and the format and country pickers moved behind a Filters button.
- feat(Meta): **Filter the archive by everything but** — format, tier and country now take several picks at once, and a second click on one turns it into "everything except this", the way the card filters work.
- feat(Meta): **Hide tournaments with nothing in them yet** — the tournament index can narrow to the events that already have decklists, or at least standings, instead of listing every date on file.
- feat(App): **Front page opens the feature tour** — marketplace prices join the landing highlights, and the tour's five chapters are now linked right from the front page.
- feat(App): **Roadmap brought up to date** — the Discord bot, tournament results archive, streamer tools, deck variants, and Swiss and 2v2 events are marked shipped, and the page now says how to influence what comes next.
- feat(App): **Why OpenRift, in prose** — the help article now tells the story without the dated feature comparison table, and points to the feature tour instead.
- fix(Meta): **One line for empty events** — an event with nothing archived shows a single status line in the tournament index instead of zero players, zero decks and a dash, and a missing flag no longer shifts the columns.
- fix(Meta): **Even filter bar heights** — the Tier and Filters buttons now stand as tall as the search field and era picker beside them.
- fix(Meta): **Event rows name the field size** — a row now says how many players the source reported and whether an event is still to come or simply has no results on file, and rows with no country keep their columns aligned.
- fix(Meta): **Archived deck tiles** — a list's chosen champion now shows beside its legend, and the pilot's name is no longer the smallest thing on the tile.
- fix(Meta): **Duplicated finishes list** — filtering a legend's record left the old copy of its finishes on the page underneath the new one.
- fix(Meta): **Legend name in the top bar** — a legend's name now sits in the page's title bar, so it stays visible while you scroll its record.
- fix(Meta): **Clickable deck tiles** — the middle of an archived deck tile did nothing, so opening the list meant hunting for a spot that worked.
- fix(Meta): **Large events stopped updating** — an event with a few thousand pairings failed to archive its round-by-round results, which also stalled the import for every event queued behind it.
- fix(Meta): **Big events missing players and decks** — events from the Chinese source were archived with only the first 1,000 finishers and 400 decklists, and now bring in the whole field however large it is.
- fix(Meta): **Decklists that repeat a card** — a list naming the same card on several lines now archives with the quantities added up, instead of failing and leaving the event without its decks.
- fix(App): **Readable error messages** — a request that times out at the gateway now explains itself instead of showing the server's raw error page.

## 2026-08-31

### Highlights

- feat(Meta): **Tournament results archive** — a new Meta section collects Riftbound events with their winners, full standings and the top-cut bracket where one was played, scoped by era, format, tier or country.
- feat(Meta): **Archived decks you can fork** — every published decklist opens as a real deck, shows how many of its cards you already own, and copies into your own decks in one click.
- feat(Meta): **Contributions and credit** — send in a missing decklist, complete a partial one, or suggest a correction, and get named on the event page if you want to be.

### Other

- feat(Meta): **Every legend's tournament record** — a page per legend listing its archived finishes, the players behind them, and the lists they registered.

## 2026-08-30

### Highlights

- feat(Groups): **Email when you're approved to join** — approval used to be silent, and now sends a welcome with what the group gets you and a link to choose what you share.
- fix(Collection): **Piltover Archive import and export rebuilt** — imports now read their Foil column, grading and notes instead of guessing from the card's rarity, a graded copy no longer merges into the ungraded ones beside it, and exports write their real format so the file goes back where it came from.

### Other

- feat(App): **One page width across the app** — pages used to settle at eight different widths, and now every page is either full width for card grids and tables, or one shared narrower column for everything else.
- fix(Tournaments): **Invite links open when signed out** — a join or staff-invite link crashed for anyone not already signed in, instead of showing the event and a sign-in button.
- fix(App): **Stage links to your own tier list** — opening one while signed out crashed the page, and now sends you to sign in and back to the same list, position and preset.
- fix(Collection): **Finish names in shared lists** — a list copied as text guessed the finish name from its internal id, writing "Metal-deluxe", and now uses the same name the rest of the app shows.
- fix(Cards): **Search keeps alternate-name matches** — the search dropdown no longer hides a card that matched on an alternate name or a printing code.
- fix(Collection): **Set and rarity names in CSV exports** — exports wrote the internal set id ("OGN") instead of the set name ("Origins").

## 2026-08-29

### Highlights

- feat(Groups): **See the cards, not the counts** — the trades band on a group page now shows the actual cards behind each thing waiting on you and each possible trade, split into what you could get and what the group would want.
- feat(Groups): **Group cards worth scanning** — each group on the index leads with the cards you could pick up there and how much has been traded lately, instead of member and list counts.
- fix(Cards): **Legends go by their champion everywhere** — a Legend now reads "Azir, Emperor of the Sands" on every surface (deck grouping, tab titles, exports, share images, the Discord bot), sorts under the champion, and drops the ", Starter" tail nobody says.
- fix(Account): **Signing in works again** — an update had broken password, Google, and Discord sign-in (codes by email still worked), all three are back.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **The box keeps your plain copies** — a deck now travels on the plain printing rather than the foil, a settled row lets you swap for another copy in the box, and a card the box holds that the deck doesn't want carries a red tick that clears it out to your inbox.
- feat(Collection): **One click to move a card** — picking a collection in the move dialog now does the move, and reopening it no longer arrives with the last collection still selected.
- feat(Groups): **Formatted group descriptions** — a group's description now takes Markdown, so bold text, lists, and links work, and a link that hides its destination shows where it leads.
- feat(Collection): **Traded cards remember where they came from** — a copy you receive through a trade arrives with a private note naming who you got it from and when, which you can reword or clear.
- feat(App): **The features tour walks through a trade** — five steps from the first match to the card landing in your collection, so it is clear what actually happens between two people.
- fix(Decks): **Variants no longer share a deck box** — a new variant used to inherit the deck box of the version it came from, so every variant held the same cards and the box's spare copies vanished from "Not in this deck". A variant now starts with no box, and you assign one where you want it.
- fix(Decks): **Tapping a stacked card shows it first** — on touch, tapping a card in a stacked deck zone unfolds it, and only a second tap on the unfolded card opens the details.
- fix(App): **Greyed-out filters on the features tour** — the catalog preview showed every domain and rarity chip disabled until its card sample loaded, and now leaves them alone until it knows.
- fix(Decks): **Move out no longer opens the card** — in a deck's box, the Move out button on a surplus copy popped the card details open behind it.

## 2026-08-28

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Card art on the group trades page** — each member card now previews the cards waiting on you, and the shared-list count moved down to the smaller footer line.
- feat(App): **Creator tools have a proper home** — the Stage and its OBS overlay, tier lists, and chat-bot card lookups each get their own section on the features tour and a help article with the setup steps, replacing the separate creators page.
- feat(App): **Features page speaks to newcomers** — the tour now leads with the free, no-ads, open-source pitch and one-minute collection import, and gives marketplace prices a full section.
- fix(Groups): **Trade counts on group cards** — possible trades now sit as a green chip beside the other badges, and the trades page drops the "Your move" label that repeated what its counts already said.

## 2026-08-27

### Highlights

- feat(App): **Search anything from anywhere** — a search button in the header (or Ctrl+K, or just `/`) opens a palette that finds any card, jumps to any page, and opens help articles, from whichever page you are on.
- feat(App): **Invite links work before you sign in** — a group, tournament, or staff invite link now shows what it leads to up front, and brings you back to it after you sign in.
- feat(Cards): **Record a card where you find it** — the card browser and every card page now show how many copies you own and which collections hold them, with plus and minus to add or remove one.
- feat(Cards): **Wishlist a card while you browse** — a heart on every card, in the browser and on its page, puts it on a wishlist and shows which lists already want it.
- fix(Account): **Password reset sends the code** — "Forgot your password?" now asks you to send the code first, so you are no longer waiting on an email that nothing had sent.
- fix(Account): **Set a password on a social account** — the profile page now offers to add one to a Google or Discord account, instead of a change form that could never work.

### Other

- feat(Groups): **Invite by link or QR** — the typed join code is gone, so inviting someone is handing them one link or letting them scan the code on your screen.
- feat(Groups): **Join requests reach you by email** — group owners and admins get a mail when someone asks to join, with a link straight to the approve buttons (switchable off in your profile).
- feat(Cards): **Set pages open in the card browser** — a set page now keeps its title bar in view while you scroll, with a button that carries the whole set into the card browser for search, sorting and filters.
- feat(Collection): **A way in from a shared list** — a shared collection, wishlist, or tradelist now offers a visitor without an account the chance to start their own.
- feat(Groups): **Group address fills itself in** — creating a group derives its web address from the name, and says up front when the address is too short or reserved.
- feat(App): **Navigation on the front page** — the front page now carries the app header, so cards, decks and the menu are one click away.
- feat(Rules): **Shareable rules searches** — a rules search now lives in the address bar, so you can link straight to it or come back to it later.
- feat(Collection): **Quick add and quick move are separate** — the Add/Move tabs are gone; both are now entries in the command palette, so moving copies between collections is visible instead of hidden behind a shortcut.
- fix(Decks): **Take a card back out of quick add** — every zone in the deck's quick add now has a minus button, so a miscount is one click to fix instead of an undo shortcut that only reversed the very last change.
- feat(Collection): **Scanner rows match the app** — the scanner's card rows and its two pickers now lead with the shared art strip, domain bar, rarity and code, and the owned count sits at the right.
- fix(Groups): **Email invites removed** — the field only worked for people who already had an account and never sent any email, and a leftover invite could silently swallow your later attempt to join by code.
- fix(Account): **Sign in returns you to your page** — signing in from the header now comes back to the page you were on, and otherwise lands in your collection rather than the marketing page.
- fix(Decks): **Local decks claimed after signing in** — the "saved only on this device" prompts now return to your deck list, which is where the decks are offered for claiming.
- fix(Collection): **Add all stays after picking a collection** — scanned cards you only identified can still be added in one go once you switch the scanner to a real destination, which now comes preselected.
- fix(Account): **Honest codes on the sign-in page** — asking for an email code no longer moves to the code box when the send failed, and the verification resend now takes you where the code can be typed.
- fix(Account): **Working resend when changing your email** — resend now really sends another code, and both it and the first send tell you when they fail.
- fix(App): **Cleaner email subject lines** — notification and sign-in emails no longer repeat "OpenRift" at the end of every subject, since the sender already says it.

## 2026-08-26

### Highlights

- feat(App): **Feature tour at /features** — a new page tours everything the app does in five chapters, with a jump menu that follows along as you scroll.
- feat(Cards): **Related cards on every card page** — each card page now ends with the cards closest to it: the tokens it creates, its champion's other cards, and similar cards from the same domain.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Odds for the hand you drew** — the Test tab now says what a mulligan could still find and what the next card could be, and marks the odds rows your hand already covers.
- feat(Decks): **Mulligan, not exchange** — the Test tab's button now says Mulligan and sits on the M key, matching the word the rules and the odds table already use.
- fix(App): **Logo beside the menu on phones** — a third icon on the right left the centred logo looking off, so it now sits next to the menu button instead.
- feat(App): **Stage and tier lists in the menu** — the creator tools now have their own Create section in the desktop More menu.
- fix(App): **Feature previews show real cards** — the scanner and promo previews on the home and features pages now take their names, codes, prices and channels from the catalog, instead of labelling live artwork with cards that weren't shown.
- fix(App): **Match tracker and Scan in the menu** — the match tracker is now reachable on desktop under More, and scanning moves out of the top bar into More on desktop while staying top level on phones.
- fix(Cards): **Art in the printing fan** — printings without their own scan now borrow the card's standard artwork in the hover fan, the same way the card in front of them does.
- fix(Trades): **Copy picker per card while settling** — settling several cards in one go now asks about each card fresh, instead of carrying the previous card's pick over and leaving the confirm button stuck.

## 2026-08-25

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Card previews in the Test tab** — hovering a sample hand card or a draw-odds row now shows the card, clicking an odds row opens its details, and the buttons no longer shift around between draws.
- feat(Decks): **Box and Plan tabs say what they do** — each tab now opens with a line explaining it, including what happens when you tick a card into the box.
- feat(Decks): **Card art in the box copy picker** — picking a different copy now shows each one's art and code, grouped under the collection it sits in, and the list takes the arrow keys.
- feat(Decks): **Card details from the Box tab** — clicking a row in a deck's Box tab now opens the card, showing the exact printing you're about to pull off the shelf.
- fix(Decks): **More room in box rows** — box rows drop the energy and power costs, so the collection each copy comes from can show its full name.
- fix(Decks): **Box copy picks stick** — picking a different copy now closes the picker, and the pick survives ticking another copy of the same card into the box.
- fix(Decks): **Quieter deck box rows** — the box names a copy's language, finish or art variant only where it tells two of your copies apart.
- fix(Cards): **Printing rows select on any click** — clicking a printing's code in the card detail list no longer jumps to the set page, so the whole row picks that printing.

## 2026-08-24

### Other

- feat(Cards): **One Owned filter** — the playset buckets and the copies slider now share a single Owned dropdown, and the mobile filter panel lists them together too.
- fix(Cards): **Consistent marketplace naming** — the price history table on card pages said "Cardtrader" while the rest of the app says "CardTrader".

## 2026-08-22

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Find a Legend by its champion** — typing "Azir" now finds "Azir, Emperor of the Sands" in search, in every card picker, in imports and in the Discord bot.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Printed names and full codes in search** — pickers now match a printing's localized name, and the catalog search matches the full code printed on a card.
- fix(Collection): **Imports no longer guess at close names** — a list entry that could mean several cards now asks you to pick, instead of importing whichever one it happened to find first.

## 2026-08-21

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Card art in the pickers** — every card and printing picker now shows a thumbnail, so near-identical variants are easy to tell apart at a glance.

- feat(App): **Card search works the same everywhere** — every picker, palette and quick-add box now ranks the same way, finds words typed in any order ("dark annie"), and matches part of a printing code.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **More ways to group promos** — the promo list can now group by set, type, supertype, domain and rarity alongside its channel, card, year and marker axes.
- feat(Cards): **Group the catalog by card** — grouping by card in printings view pools every printing of a card into one section.
- feat(Cards): **Search scope moved into the field** — a chip in the search box now shows which fields you are searching, including when you type a shortcut like `n:`, and opens the list to change it.
- feat(Cards): **One look for printing lists** — card details, deck and tier menus, imports, quick add and the scanner now describe a printing the same way: art, language, rarity, code, then what makes it special.
- feat(Decks): **Matching deck plan pickers** — the key card, battlefield and swap dropdowns now share one row with art, cost and power, and the card's type.
- fix(Decks): **Deck plan card search** — the plan picker now folds punctuation like the rest of the app, so typing "kaisa" finds "Kai'Sa".
- fix(Decks): **Key card suggestions** — the deck plan's key card search no longer lists an arbitrary slice of the catalog before you type.
- fix(App): **Readable menus on hover** — grey text in right-click menus (printing codes, move hints) turned illegible on the gold highlight.

## 2026-08-20

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Promo list rebuilt around promos** — the list view now shows each printing's channel, markers and note in place of its set, type and rarity, on phones too.
- feat(Cards): **Start a submission from an existing card** — the submit-a-card page can now fill itself in from a card OpenRift already knows, and says up front that a partial entry is fine.
- feat(Cards): **Sources for promo cards** — a promo printing can now cite where its claims come from, on the card page and as linked source marks in the promo list.
- fix(Cards): **Clearer printings on the submit form** — printings now name their language and finish instead of a number, and an error inside a collapsed one no longer blocks submitting silently.
- fix(Cards): **Readable hover on card pages** — hovering a printing, a price row, or an owned-collections popover turned the background gold and left the text on it barely legible.

## 2026-08-18

### Other

- fix(Cards): **Domain and rarity names in tooltips** — domain icons on deck tiles and rows named the domain "fury" instead of "Fury", as did the domain and rarity icons on a card's details.
- fix(Decks): **Deck menu submenus stay put** — picking "Change format" or "Add to folder" on a deck opened that deck instead of the submenu.
- fix(Decks): **Card browser stays open** — adding a card to a deck could bounce you back to the deck overview, losing the zone you were building in.
- fix(App): **Fast double actions land once** — clicking twice or acting from two tabs at the same moment (submitting a tournament deck, clearing a collection while a trade lands, toggling a Discord trade channel) now applies once instead of racing itself into duplicates or lost changes.

## 2026-08-17

### Other

- feat(App): **Hide the OBS overlay** — Hide (or H on the stage) takes the card or ranking off stream for a break and puts the same one back, no second push needed.
- fix(Trades): **Trade history survives deletions** — completed trades now keep the other person's and the group's name when an account or group is deleted, instead of vanishing from your history.

## 2026-08-15

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Tier lists** — rank a set from S down to D on a board you build by dragging cards, then share the link or take the image into a thumbnail.
- feat(App): **The Stage** — put cards in front of an audience: a full-screen show you drive from the keyboard, and a transparent browser source you push cards to in OBS.
- feat(App): **One share dialog everywhere** — decks, collections, lists, and tier lists now share it: the link and its QR on one tab, the image with shape, size, and scan-code choices on the other.
- feat(Collection): **Download your collection as an image** — the share dialog now saves a collection as a wide or tall picture, which before existed only as the link preview.
- feat(Decks): **One page for every deck comparison** — comparing two versions or another deck now opens a full page with card art down both sides, searchable deck pickers, and a pasted deck code or list you can then save as a deck.
- feat(Decks): **All deck PDFs under Print** — proxies, the registration sheet, and the printable deck sheet moved into one Print dialog, opened from Print in the deck menu.
- feat(App): **A proper match board** — each player's side now shows the art of a legend you pick, scores through Conquer, Hold and Ability buttons instead of a hidden tap, and marks how close the game is with a pip per point.
- fix(Tournaments): **Deck deadlines in your timezone** — submission deadlines showed the server's clock without saying so, and now show yours.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Delete a deck from its own page** — the deck menu now ends with Delete, and the Variants dialog can delete a single version while the rest of the family stays.
- feat(App): **A page for creators** — /creators gathers the Stage, tier lists, and the chat-bot card lookups in one place, each with a link straight to it and the setup it needs.
- feat(Decks): **Import a deck straight from another site** — a Firefox add-on sends the decklist you are looking at to the import page in one click, and a new help article covers installing and using it.
- feat(Decks): **Card art in the deck plan pickers** — the battlefield, opponent, and swap dropdowns now show each card's art, so lookalike names are easy to tell apart.
- feat(Decks): **Add card is spelled out** — the deck editor's plus button now carries its label on wider screens instead of standing alone as an icon.
- feat(Decks): **Variant timeline in one row** — versions that share no history now sit side by side, newest on the right, instead of stacking into a column of one-dot rows.
- feat(Decks): **See what changed without leaving the deck** — clicking a dot or a change count on the timeline opens the card-by-card list for that step.
- feat(Decks): **Dated timeline, fuller names** — each version on the variant timeline now shows the day it last changed beside its name, and long deck names run much further before they cut off.
- feat(Decks): **Branch from any version** — the Variants dialog creates a variant inline now, with a pick of which version it comes from, so cancelling leaves you where you were.
- feat(Decks): **Edit the description from its corner** — the pencil moved to the top right of the description instead of sitting underneath it.
- feat(App): **Share, Export, and Print untangled** — every page now uses the same three entries with the same icons: Share for links and images, Export for data, Print for PDFs.
- feat(App): **Tall list and bundle images** — list, collection, and profile bundle images can now render in 9:16 for stories, with the size and QR options decks already had.
- feat(App): **One date format everywhere** — dates now read as 2026-08-15 across the app, so there is no guessing whether 8/9 means August or September.
- feat(App): **Undo a mis-tapped point** — the match menu in the middle of the board names the last change and reverses it, and tapping a score opens buttons to correct a total that drifted.
- feat(App): **XP only when you need it** — the match tracker keeps XP as a small tab until someone taps it, so decks that never use it get the space back.
- feat(Decks): **Bigger, optional scan code on deck images** — the code moved from the footer up to the top corner, where it has the room to actually be scannable, and a switch on the share dialog's Image tab leaves it off.
- fix(Decks): **Variants list stops nesting** — versions were indented under each other whether or not they were related, and now each sits on its own line with a connecting line only where one really came from another.
- fix(Tournaments): **Staff invite links shown in full** — the invite row now shows the whole link with copy and QR instead of a truncated pill.
- fix(App): **Tier list embeds resolve** — sites that read embed info from a shared tier list link no longer hit a missing endpoint.
- fix(App): **Dragged cards show the right art** — the card following your cursor could show a different printing than the one you picked up, in both the deck builder and collections.
- fix(Decks): **Timeline change counts keep up** — the counts and card lists on the variant timeline were stuck on the deck as it was when the page opened, and now follow your edits.
- fix(Decks): **Variant families pick the right main deck** — deleting or unlinking the main deck of a variant family could hand the role to any sibling; it now goes to the one you edited most recently.

## 2026-08-14

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Deck variants** — keep a budget build next to the full one, branch a copy before rebuilding, link two decks you already have, and compare any two versions; variants group under one deck-list entry.
- feat(Decks): **Variant history on the deck page** — a branch graph under the deck title shows earlier versions and sibling builds, what changed at each step, and jumps straight into a full comparison.
- feat(Collection): **Share images name the list** — a shared list, collection, or bundle now unfurls with its name, its owner, and a scannable code back to it, instead of an unlabelled wall of card art.
- feat(Collection): **Separate price gains from new cards** — the value chart now draws a second line holding each card at its value the day you added it, so the gap between them is what the market did rather than what you bought.
- feat(Groups): **Wishlist cards in the group box** — the group overview counts the cards you want that are sitting in a shared bulk collection, and the box can filter down to just those, with amounts netted against trades already coming your way.
- fix(Cards): **Snappier card browser** — filters now apply in about half the time, and scrolling the grid holds a steady frame rate on phones.
- fix(Cards): **Faster filtering on phones** — the filter drawer opens in about half the time, and once it is open each filter you tap applies a quarter quicker.
- fix(Cards): **Quicker first load** — the card list now downloads your own languages first and fetches the rest quietly once the page is up, roughly halving what has to arrive before you see any cards.
- fix(Collection): **Faster stats filtering** — the statistics page no longer stutters when you add or remove filters, and sets you own stop dropping out of the set picker as you narrow things down.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Tall deck image for stories** — the export dialog now offers a tall version of the deck image, sized for a story or a short video, with much bigger cards than the wide one.
- fix(Cards): **Card data stops re-downloading every day** — the cached card list expired at midnight and came down again in full on your next visit, even when nothing about the cards had changed. It now stays until they actually change.
- feat(Decks): **Compare against your own decks** — the compare dialog now lists your decks to pick from, so seeing how two of your builds differ no longer means exporting one of them first.
- feat(App): **One look for every export image** — deck, list, and tier list images now share a heading, a scan code at one readable size, and matching card tiles, and list downloads come at the same high resolution as decks.
- feat(App): **Frosted bars are optional** — blurring the page behind the header and toolbars costs frame rate while scrolling, so it is off by default with a switch in Display settings.
- feat(Cards): **Report card errors from the popup** — the card detail popup and side pane now link to the correction form, so you no longer have to open the full card page first.
- feat(Decks): **Drag the deck cover to frame it** — the cover preview can be dragged up and down to pick the part of the art you want, and the focus slider follows along.
- fix(Decks): **Dismissing a dialog opened a deck** — clicking outside a dialog on the deck list closed it and opened the deck behind it in the same click.
- fix(App): **Clearer card thumbnails in lists** — every list row now leads with a wide crop of the art, so battlefields show whole instead of as a sliver and rows stop changing height between card shapes.
- fix(Cards): **Tidier printing stacks** — a card with many printings no longer draws a silhouette for every one of them, showing at most five stacked edges while the rest appear when you fan the stack out.
- fix(Cards): **Hiding the detail panel stays hidden** — closing the side panel from the toolbar button popped the selected card back up as a dialog instead of putting it away.

## 2026-08-13

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **See what happened to cards you sent in** — every submission from the contribute form now has a status page showing whether it was applied, already correct, or not used, with a reason when there is one.
- feat(Cards): **Release dates per language** — a set now carries its own date for each language it comes out in, so cards you cannot buy in your language yet are marked as previews until that date passes.
- feat(Groups): **Members page as a roster** — the group's members are now a searchable, sortable list showing how many cards each person offers and wants, with contact icons that reveal a handle and copy it on tap.
- feat(Trades): **Check what you own before offering** — the available count on a card you would give away opens a breakdown of every variant you own and the collections holding them.
- feat(Groups): **Possible trades on the groups list** — each group card now shows how many possible trades it holds, so you can see where to go without opening every group.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Hand the scanner to your phone** — on a desktop the scan page now shows a code you can point a phone at, since a rear camera reads cards better than a webcam.
- fix(Cards): **No TCGplayer price on Chinese cards** — TCGplayer only sells English stock, so Simplified Chinese printings were showing the English card's price instead of none.
- fix(Groups): **Own member page works again** — opening your own entry in a group's member list no longer fails with a trade error, and shows what you share with the group.

## 2026-08-12

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Identify-first scanning** — the scanner now names and counts cards first and adds them only when you pick a collection, instead of adding as it goes.
- feat(Collection): **Scan sessions survive leaving the page** — navigating away or reloading no longer clears the scanned list, and a session older than a day offers a fresh start.
- feat(App): **Scan from the main menu** — the card scanner now sits right in the menu on every page, and the menu itself is grouped into Play, Organize, and Explore sections instead of one long list.
- feat(Decks): **Sort a deck by card ID** — the deck view can now order cards by set and collector number, and sorting by ID everywhere follows the set order instead of the letters in the code.
- feat(Decks): **Cards on their way from a trade** — a deck's missing cards now mark the copies already reserved to you in a swap, so you don't buy one that's about to arrive.

- fix(Trades): **Trade counts agree everywhere** — the members page, the Trades page and a member's trade sheet now count from one rule, so a person the sheet calls settled up no longer shows trades waiting on them.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Suggestions name both lists** — a suggestion now says which of their lists the card sits on next to which of yours, instead of hiding it behind a hover.
- fix(Groups): **"Traded" counts your own trades** — the count beside a member is now the cards you two have swapped, not everything they have done with anyone in the group.
- feat(Collection): **Group All Cards by collection** — in copies view the All Cards grid can now split into a section per collection, so you can see where each copy actually sits.
- feat(Decks): **Box tab reads like the deck list** — one list in the deck's own zones, sort and grouping, with a row per copy showing its art, printing and condition, a tick to move it in or out, and a source to pick it from.
- feat(Collection): **Card details inside the scanner** — Details on a scanned card opens the usual card overlay in place instead of leaving for the card page.
- feat(Collection): **Printing picker grouped by language** — switching or picking a printing now shows one tab per language when a card exists in several.
- feat(App): **Scanner moved to /scan** — the scan page has its own top-level address; old /collections/scan bookmarks need updating.
- feat(Trades): **Suggestions from your other groups** — a member's card on the Trades page now says when possible trades with them sit in another group you share, and their member page counts those too.
- fix(Trades): **Their shared lists from the trade sheet** — the link to a member's wishlists and tradelists now sits in the sheet's header, where it used to disappear as soon as you had a trade or suggestion with them.
- fix(Trades): **Suggestions across shared groups** — a card you can trade through two shared groups is one suggestion again instead of two identical ones, and every trade sheet row now names the group it belongs to.
- fix(Collection): **Picker lists line up** — the filter box in the move and add dialogs now sits at the same width as the list under it, with a clear gap between the two.
- fix(Trades): **Trade sheet reads as two piles** — the open sections now list what you get before what you give, each in catalog order, and rows no longer repeat the status their heading already says.
- fix(Trades): **Value bar on cheap trades** — a swap worth under one unit of currency now fills the give/get bar properly instead of leaving most of it empty.
- fix(Groups): **Card details on the trades and member pages** — opening a card from a trade row no longer fails to load for signed-in owners of that card.
- fix(Collection): **Owned count after taking from a group box** — taking a card out of a group's collection now raises your own owned count right away, instead of only after a reload.

## 2026-08-11

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **A trade sheet for every trading partner** — one page per member showing your live trades both ways, suggestions, history and value, pooled across every group you share.
- feat(Trades): **Trades page rebuilt around people** — whatever needs you comes first, then one card per member with the whole relationship at a glance, instead of status sections.
- feat(Trades): **At the table, start to finish** — one session for a meetup: answer open requests on the spot, count what actually changed hands, and settle only that much, with anything missing staying an open trade for next time.
- feat(Collection): **Scan now, add later** — a "Just identify" session can be committed afterwards: one button adds everything it counted to a collection of your choice, and offers to tick off matching wishlist entries.
- feat(Collection): **See what a pack was worth as you scan** — every scanned card now shows its price, wishlist heart and owned count, with a session total and best pull (duplicates count even in Just identify mode).
- feat(Trades): **Choose the copy you handed over** — confirming your half of a swap now asks which copy left whenever your copies differ or sit in different collections, instead of removing whichever one was pinned.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Card details from a trade row** — clicking a card's name on a trade or suggestion opens its details, and arrow keys or a swipe step through the rest of the list.
- fix(Collection): **Details follow the selected card** — moving or removing the card you have open now moves the detail panel on to the card that takes its place, instead of leaving the old one on screen.
- fix(Collection): **Clicking a copy selects that copy** — in copies view, clicking one of several copies of a card now highlights the one you clicked rather than jumping to the first.

## 2026-08-10

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Folders for your decks** — sort decks into folders you name yourself, group the list by them, and filter to one; a deck can sit in several folders at once.
- feat(Trades): **Each side confirms its own half of a swap** — instead of one person marking the whole trade done, you say you handed the cards over or that you got them, and the trade closes once you both have.
- feat(Decks): **Deck stats before you import** — the import preview now shows the deck's size, domains and format legality, plus how much of it you already own and what the rest would cost.
- feat(Decks): **Deck import on phones** — the preview reads as a list of cards, matched rows tuck their controls behind a tap, and the import button stays in reach at the bottom.
- feat(Decks): **Card details from the missing list** — clicking a card in a deck's missing-cards list now opens its details over the list, with arrow keys stepping through the cards you still need, instead of leaving the page.
- feat(Decks): **Tokens your deck needs** — deck and shared deck pages now list the tokens your cards create as one more section of the deck, and clicking one opens its card details.
- feat(Decks): **Tell a deck which box it lives in** — pick or create the box a deck is stored in, and a new Box tab shows what is already in it, which collection to pull each remaining card from, ticks cards off as you sort them, and offers to move out anything the deck doesn't need.
- feat(Decks): **Deck value is what it costs, not what's pinned** — every price on the deck page now uses the cheapest printing in your languages, so pinning a premium art no longer inflates the value; the premium figure moved into the value popup.
- feat(Decks): **Deck guides with card links** — the description is now a full guide editor: type [[ to link any card (hover shows it, click opens it), write with a live preview, edit it straight from the deck page, and add up to five links (YouTube, RiftMana, TopDeck.gg and more) crediting where the deck came from.
- feat(Decks): **See which cards you borrowed** — deck rows now mark the copies you have on loan and name who lent them, the card bands and Collection chart count them apart from what you own, and a deck completed with a friend's cards says "Ready to play" rather than claiming you own it.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Action needed reads as a list of people** — a member with several waiting trades now starts folded, so you see who is waiting and on how much before opening anything, and can accept the lot from the header.
- feat(Decks): **Display options in one menu** — the deck toolbar's icon toggles (every copy, owned highlights, prices, your printings) now sit behind one options button, with labels.
- feat(Decks): **Imports remember where the deck came from** — sending a deck over with the browser extension now offers the page it came from as a deck link, ready to save or drop on the review step.
- feat(Trades): **Say which copy you handed over** — confirming your half of a swap now offers a "Choose which copies…" option, so the copy that leaves your collection is the one that actually changed hands, from any of your collections.
- feat(Groups): **Group cards say what the actions are** — a group card now shows how many trade requests are waiting on your answer and, separately, how many agreed swaps you still have to confirm, instead of one vague "actions needed" count.
- feat(Decks): **Cost to complete beside the deck value** — the price breakdown drops the owned total and shows what you are missing as a second column, split into deck and sideboard.
- feat(Decks): **Lighter deck builder sidebar** — the ownership and price block is gone from the sidebar (the deck page header already carries those figures), and its charts now match the ones on the deck page.
- feat(Decks): **Deck filters you can link to and filter on a phone** — the deck list now filters like the card browser, with match counts on every option, a filter sheet on phones, and the filters in the address bar so you can share or bookmark a filtered list.
- feat(Cards): **Price history opens with the card** — the chart now shows by default, names the marketplace it plots and how far the price moved, and the buy buttons sit below it.
- feat(Decks): **Import lists from TopDeck.gg** — decklists copied from TopDeck.gg now paste in directly, with each card landing in the right zone.
- feat(Decks): **Clearer ownership counts** — the header shows one owned-and-missing chip that counts the sideboard separately, and cards with copies locked away from deck building now show a lock icon explaining why they don't count.
- feat(Decks): **Test bench keyboard shortcuts** — draw a hand (N), exchange cards (E), and draw (D) from the keyboard, with the keys shown on the buttons.
- feat(Decks): **Cleaner stacks view** — piles read as a cover card over uniform name strips, battlefields stack the same way, corners and edges match the card browser, and hovering never pops the side preview.
- fix(Trades): **One clear button when confirming a swap** — the button now spells out the whole action ("Got them, add to Inbox"), and the rarer variants that leave your collection alone moved into the menu beside it.
- fix(Trades): **Cards already promised to someone else** — a card whose copies are all tied up in an open offer to another member no longer shows as a possible trade, so requesting it can no longer fail as unavailable.
- fix(Cards): **Page jump when opening a card** — the page scrolled to the top when card details opened and back again when they closed, on every surface.
- fix(Trades): **Card preview on phones** — tapping a possible-trade row popped a large card preview over most of the screen with no way to close it, so the preview is now mouse-only.
- fix(Decks): **Bigger grid and list buttons** — the view switch in the deck search row was smaller than the controls beside it and is now the same height.
- fix(Decks): **Optional deck name on import** — the field starts empty with "Imported Deck" as a placeholder, so there is nothing to clear before importing.
- fix(Decks): **Jump to cards that need attention** — the "need attention" count in the import summary now scrolls straight to the first row that still needs work.
- fix(Decks): **Import rows name the zone once** — every row of the import preview spelled out its zone twice, as text and again in the dropdown beside it.
- fix(App): **No zoom when pasting on iPhone** — tapping the paste box on an import screen no longer zooms the whole page in.
- fix(App): **Smoother expanding sections** — clicking an expanding section again while it opens now reverses it instead of jumping to full height first.
- fix(Decks): **Tidier deck list** — tiles and rows now show the same build state and figures as the deck page, the list lines its columns up and leaves the deck name more room, and nothing gets clipped on narrow tiles.
- fix(Decks): **Stats filter chip on phones** — filtering the deck by clicking a stats bar showed a chip that ran off the screen edge on narrow phones, so it now wraps onto two lines.
- fix(Decks): **Split a card to the sideboard on phones** — long-pressing a deck row with several copies now offers a move-1 entry per zone, so you can send a single copy to the sideboard without a shift key.
- fix(Decks): **Buy button in the missing-cards list** — on phones the cart sat at the bottom of each row instead of centered beside the card it belongs to.
- fix(Decks): **Champion named once in the deck identity** — the legend and the champion no longer both spell out the same champion name on deck pages, tiles, and list rows.
- fix(Decks): **Power cost in deck rows** — a two-domain card showed the colorless rune instead of the wild Power symbol the card art uses, and screen readers now read the cost once instead of once per pip.
- fix(Decks): **Deck list view columns** — the list shows each card's power cost on phones again, and a row with locked copies or no price on file no longer pushes the columns after the name out of line with the rows above it.
- fix(Decks): **Domain strip in the deck builder sidebar** — the strip under the deck's name showed a wash of its legend's colors, so it now splits by how many cards each domain actually contributes, like the overview.
- fix(Decks): **Deck tile values match the deck page** — a tile priced the deck using printings in languages you don't collect, so it could read lower than the deck itself.
- fix(Cards): **Steadier card details** — the window no longer opens oversized before snapping down, and stepping between printings keeps the price chart's place instead of collapsing the layout for a moment.
- fix(Cards): **Arrow keys in the card window** — stepping between cards and printings with the keyboard now works while the window is open, matching the grid, and the panel's close button closes the panel instead of just emptying it.
- fix(Decks): **Deck tab bar on phones** — the row of view buttons ran off the screen edge, so the tabs now carry the grid, stacks, and list switch plus an options sheet, with the plan's save and clear buttons on that same row.
- fix(Decks): **Missing card images** — a card whose printing has no image now shows a named placeholder instead of disappearing from the deck.

## 2026-08-07

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Stacks view** — a third deck layout besides grid and list: cards fan into piles showing their name bars, and hovering a bar unfolds the full card in place.
- feat(Decks): **Quick-add palette** — press Ctrl+K in the deck builder, type a card name, and Enter adds it straight to the right zone, sideboard and champion picks included.
- feat(Decks): **Custom deck cover art** — pick any card in the deck as the backdrop of its hero, tile, and share image, with an adjustable crop.
- feat(Decks): **Turn-1 and curve-out odds** — the stats band now shows how often your opening hand holds a turn-one play, and how often you can play something on every turn through turn 3.
- feat(Cards): **Card details open in a window** — clicking a card now opens a wide window with the art and text side by side instead of shrinking the grid, and the new options-bar button docks the side panel for good if you prefer it.
- feat(Decks): **Rarity and collection in the deck stats** — two new lens bars show the deck's rarity split and how much of it you own, and clicking a segment filters the cards like the other charts.
- feat(Decks): **Shared decks get real tabs** — shared deck pages now use the same Deck, Test, and Plan tabs as your own decks instead of one long page.
- feat(Decks): **Card art in the deck's list view** — every row now leads with a small art preview, next to the prices and owned counts it already showed.
- feat(Cards): **Bigger cards at high column counts** — the spacing between cards now shrinks as you add columns, so at 12 across each card is about a sixth larger than before.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Printings split by language** — a card printed in several languages now lists them under one tab per language, with the count on each tab, instead of one long mixed list.
- feat(Decks): **Group deck views your way** — grid, stacks, and list can group cards by type, energy, domain, or what you own, with sorting inside each group.
- feat(Decks): **Clearer stats charts** — each chart now has its own colors (domain colors stay on Power, where they matter most), the charts sit on one row when the screen fits them, and hairlines separate them.
- feat(Decks): **Collapsible zones** — a zone can fold down to its header line to get long lists out of the way.
- feat(Decks): **Prices on the deck grid** — a new toggle shows each card's price directly on its image.
- feat(Decks): **Description preview on deck tiles** — the deck list shows the first line of each deck's description.
- feat(Decks): **Redo on phones** — the phone editor now offers redo next to undo, in the bottom dock and the top bar.
- feat(Cards): **Selected card glows** — the highlight was a thin tint you could barely see behind the card, and is now a soft glow in the card's domain colors.
- fix(Decks): **Truer test hands and draw odds** — exchanged mulligan cards now go to the bottom of the deck instead of vanishing, and a card pinned to two printings counts as one row with combined odds.
- fix(Decks): **Draw-odds groups save again** — saving a custom draw-odds group no longer fails with a validation error.

## 2026-08-06

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **A deck dock on phones** — while adding cards on a phone, a bottom bar shows the zone's fill, your latest change, and an undo button, and tapping it opens the zone list.
- feat(Decks): **Compare with another deck** — paste a deck code, share link, or card list to see exactly what to add, cut, or adjust, with owned counts on the additions.
- feat(Decks): **See what you own at a glance** — deck thumbnails carry a small band split by your copies: green for the printing shown, blue for other printings you own, empty for missing. A pinned printing now shows a small pin instead of a colored border.
- feat(Decks): **Undo in the deck builder** — any card change can be taken back with Ctrl+Z or the new top-bar buttons (Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes), including bulk removes.
- feat(Decks): **Test sideboard swaps** — the Test tab lets you bring sideboard cards in and take main-deck cards out to see how hands and draw odds change, without touching the deck.
- feat(Decks): **Rune odds by turn** — the Test tab shows the chance of having channeled enough runes of each domain by turns 1 to 4, going first or second.
- feat(Decks): **Every deck gets a hero** — the overview and shared decks open with the deck's legend and champion art over its domain colors, deck status as tappable chips, and link previews glow to match.
- feat(Decks): **Test your opening hand** — the new Test tab draws sample hands with the real rule (4 cards, exchange up to 2 once) and lists every card's chance to show up early, on your decks and shared ones.
- feat(Decks): **See the deck in your printings** — a toggle swaps every card image to the version you own, so the deck looks like what you would actually sleeve up.
- fix(Decks): **Banned cards now fail validation** — a Constructed or Custom-Region deck holding a banned card is flagged instead of passing as legal.
- fix(Decks): **Tokens no longer offered in the deck builder** — tokens are created during play, so they no longer show up when browsing a zone, can't be added to a deck, and are flagged if an imported list contains one.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Drag and drop in list view** — the deck's list mode now moves cards between zones by dragging, just like the thumbnail grid.
- feat(Decks): **Sidebar header returns to the overview** — clicking the deck's name and art in the sidebar goes back to the overview, and the Overview button only shows while a zone is open.
- feat(Decks): **Deck identity while editing** — the sidebar shows the deck's name, art and completion count, and the top bar carries the count while a zone is open.
- feat(Decks): **Deck, Test and Plan tabs** — the deck page splits into tabs under the hero, with the view controls on the same row and the stats charts as a collapsible section right above the cards they filter.
- feat(Decks): **Cheapest way to finish a deck** — missing-card prices now use the cheapest printing in your languages instead of the creator's pinned versions, with the as-shown cost in the value breakdown.
- feat(Decks): **Lighter deck overview** — zones drop their boxes for plain labeled sections (the sidebar's zone panel too), card images are larger by default, and clicking a zone's header opens it for editing.
- feat(Decks): **Sections at a glance on shared decks** — a slim bar under the hero jumps to the deck, the test bench, or the plan, with the view controls on the same row.
- feat(Decks): **List view uses the whole screen** — the deck's list mode now flows into as many columns as fit your window instead of two fixed ones.
- feat(Decks): **Deck list flags the exact card** — a rule problem now shows a warning on the offending row.
- feat(Decks): **Sidebar shows what you're short** — a card you don't fully own carries an amber owned count on its row, and Stats and Ownership now share one panel.
- feat(Decks): **Legend and champion are clickable** — their names in the hero open the card's details.

- feat(Decks): **Edit counts on the deck view** — hovering a card's count turns it into minus and plus controls with a remove button, so quantity tweaks no longer need the sidebar or menus.
- feat(Decks): **Card size on the deck overview** — the grid now uses a column stepper like the card browser, so cards fit the window instead of turning huge on a phone, and the count sticks per device.
- fix(Decks): **Card preview stays out of the way** — hovering a deck card now shows the large preview on the opposite side of the screen, instead of chasing the cursor or covering the rows you are pointing at.
- fix(Decks): **Dropping a card on the wrong zone no longer removes it** — releasing a dragged card over a zone that can't take it is now a no-op instead of deleting a copy.
- fix(Decks): **Dragging scrolls the zone panel** — dragging a card near the top or bottom of the left zone panel now scrolls the panel itself instead of the page behind it.
- fix(Decks): **Plan tab hosts the plan** — the tab now opens the full plan editor instead of an empty page, with its save and clear actions in the tab row (the separate sidebar button is gone).
- fix(Decks): **Cleaner odds settings** — the group picker drops the browser's number spinners and its filler text, and on a shared deck it notes that copying the deck lets you add your own card groups.
- fix(Decks): **Zone counts turn green when done** — a complete zone (12/12 runes, 39/39 main deck) now shows its count in green in the sidebar and the overview instead of staying grey.
- fix(Decks): **A missing champion no longer blames the main deck** — a full 39-card main deck used to show a red "39/40, need 1 more" when the Chosen Champion slot was empty; the main deck now counts against 39 and the missing champion is reported on its own zone.
- fix(Decks): **Shared decks read better** — the page opens straight with the deck's hero (no duplicate title bar), shows who shared it with their avatar, names what an empty zone is missing, and a turned-off share link explains itself instead of showing a 404 page.
- fix(Decks): **One badge style everywhere** — the deck list's row view now shows the same format badge as the tiles (format name with a check or warning) instead of plain Valid or Invalid.
- fix(Decks): **Charts say what they count** — the energy curve now notes that it counts the main deck and champion only.
- fix(Decks): **Owned count matches the deck size** — the owned figure now counts the deck proper (runes included, sideboard not), so it lines up with the completion count instead of using a different total.
- fix(Collection): **Dynamic lists count every copy you own** — with a price range set, "Only what I'm missing" ignored the copies priced outside it, so a card you already had a playset of kept asking for another.

## 2026-08-05

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **File traded cards in one press** — a card you received now goes straight to your inbox, with a three-dot menu to send it elsewhere (the button then remembers that collection) and an Add all button per member.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Dynamic lists marked in the sidebar** — a list filled by a rule now carries a sparkle, so an empty-looking count no longer reads as an empty list.
- feat(Collection): **List header fits a phone** — a list now shows its value next to the title like a collection does, with group visibility and dynamic rules moved into the three-dot menu.
- feat(Collection): **Empty list points at dynamic rules** — a list with nothing on it now leads with setting up a rule that fills it for you, instead of only offering the catalog.
- feat(Collection): **Roomier collection header** — Scan and Quick add moved into the three-dot menu on a single collection (they stay in the bar on All cards and the inbox), and an empty collection now offers Scan alongside Browse & add.
- feat(Decks): **Import links accept text decklists** — a share link to the deck import page can now carry a full text list and a deck name, not just a compact deck code.
- feat(Cards): **Backspace clears the search scope** — with the search narrowed to a field, one press in the empty box puts it back to searching everything.
- fix(Collection): **Rule hints readable on a phone** — the small (i) next to Standard and Price in the rule builder needed a mouse hover, and now opens on tap.

## 2026-08-04

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Manage cards on a list** — wishlists and tradelists get the same top-bar Manage button and Select all as a collection, so bulk move and remove no longer hide behind a small toolbar icon.
- fix(Collection): **Statistics filters all work now** — chips set to exclude did nothing, and keywords, tags, custom tags, size and standard-printing were ignored outright; all of them now narrow completion, cost to complete and the value chart.

### Other

- feat(Groups): **Approve join requests from the group page** — waiting requests now sit at the top of the group with Approve and Deny, instead of only on the members page.
- feat(Collection): **More lists visible in the sidebar** — each section's create button moved up into its header, so the space goes to your collections and lists instead of to buttons.
- feat(Trades): **Trades in set order** — possible trades and your open and completed trades now list by set and card number, the way the same cards read in the card browser and in a binder.
- feat(Account): **Sharing all your lists lives in your profile** — the one link covering every wishlist and tradelist, its chat image and its binder QR sheet now sit at the top of your profile settings, and the sidebar entry is gone.
- fix(Trades): **Clearer trade status on cards** — a card in a trade now reads the same whichever side you are on (Requested, Offered, Reserved, Traded), with an arrow showing whether it is coming in or going out.
- fix(Trades): **Group trades fit on a phone** — member names and their trade values now stack onto two lines instead of squeezing each other, and a long trade row no longer pushes the page sideways.
- fix(Collection): **Sidebar reordering works on touch again** — dragging a collection or list by its grip opened the row's right-click menu instead of moving the row.
- fix(App): **Date headings on What's new** — each day's heading sat on a flat opaque strip that cut a rectangle out of the page background, and now blends in like the other sticky headers.
- fix(App): **Selected option in a button row** — the active choice (stats grouping, chart time range, price source, activity action and time filters) had its bottom-right corner clipped off, and now looks like the toggles used everywhere else.
- fix(Trades): **Shared lists start folded** — each member in Wishlists & tradelists is one line showing how many lists they share, opened when you want them, with their name linking to their page.
- fix(Trades): **Calmer trade rows** — rows no longer repeat the member's name or the status the heading above them already carries (only the odd one out is labelled), and cancelling an agreed trade moved into the row's three-dot menu so "Mark traded" stands alone.
- fix(Collection): **Playset totals skip Runes and Other** — those cards have no playset to chase, so counting three of each pushed the completion percentage down for nothing.

## 2026-08-03

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Scan cards with your camera** — hold a card in front of your phone and it is added to the collection you picked, recognised on the device itself so no pictures are uploaded.
- feat(Collection): **Number keys add copies** — click a card in the grid, press a number from 1 to 9, and that many copies land in one press.
- feat(Trades): **Trade status on your own cards** — a copy you have offered, reserved or already handed over now says so in your collection and on your lists, and the same copy can no longer be promised to two people at once.
- feat(Trades): **Choose which copy you hand over** — accepting a request lets you pick, and only asks when the copies actually differ, so a graded or noted card is never promised by accident.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Long trade lists fold away** — one member with dozens of open trades or suggestions no longer fills the whole page, showing the first five with a "Show more" toggle for the rest.
- feat(Groups): **Group counts link where they belong** — the members, collections and cards-traded counts under a group's name now take you to those pages.
- feat(Collection): **Tidy the sidebar with Show more** — right-click any collection or list to push it behind a "Show more" toggle, so a long sidebar keeps only what you use often in view.
- feat(Collection): **Right-click menu on sidebar rows** — renaming, sharing, deck-building availability and deleting are now reachable straight from the row, without opening the page first.
- feat(Collection): **Export just the cards you filtered to** — exporting a wishlist or tradelist while filters are on now offers the cards on screen instead of the whole list, with a checkbox to take everything anyway.
- feat(Collection): **Move a list's copies into a collection** — a tradelist or organize list can now file the cards behind it into another collection, all at once from the list's menu or per card by right-click, so a pile you sorted out with a dynamic rule can go straight to the bulk box.
- feat(Collection): **Auto-scan for a phone on a stand** — scanning now counts each card once however long you hold it up, and a toggle switches to counting every copy dealt past a propped-up camera.
- feat(Collection): **Scan without collecting** — the scanner can name cards without adding them anywhere, every scanned card links through to its card page, and one button clears everything a sitting added.
- feat(Collection): **Drag quantities work on lists too** — dropping a card stack on a wishlist or tradelist now takes one copy, the number key you hold, or the whole stack with Shift, just like dropping on a collection.
- feat(Trades): **Wishlists show what is coming** — a card someone has offered or reserved for you now shows that on the wishlist you asked for it on, instead of only on the Trades page.
- feat(Collection): **Share links point members at the full view** — opening a collection's public link while signed in now offers a way through to the version that lets you add and take copies, instead of stranding you on the read-only page.
- fix(Trades): **Reserved cards stop reappearing as offers** — reserving the spare of a keep-N tradelist rule no longer puts one of the copies you meant to keep up for trade instead.
- fix(Trades): **No more suggestions for cards already promised** — a card someone reserved for you, or one with an open request, stops showing as a trade opportunity in your other shared groups.
- fix(Collection): **Scans follow your card language** — a card set to English could still be filed as Simplified Chinese, and mixed stacks now have an "any language" setting for the old behaviour.
- fix(Collection): **Identify now reads the card in front of you** — it answered with whatever the camera had last worked out, often the card before, and now takes a fresh picture, shows it while it thinks, and adds the card when it is sure.
- fix(Collection): **Promo printings stop asking** — a card that exists plain, foil and foil with a promo stamp opened the printing picker every time, and now files as the plain one unless the stamp is actually seen.
- fix(Collection): **Scan buttons stay on screen** — the controls under the newest scanned card were cut off at the bottom edge, and they now move to each new card instead of staying on an older one.
- fix(App): **Much smaller PDF downloads** — every generated PDF (binder QR sheets, proxy sheets, registration sheets, deck images) stored its pictures uncompressed, so a sheet holding one QR code weighed 6.5 MB instead of a few hundred kilobytes.
- fix(Collection): **Sharing a group binder no longer crashes** — opening the share dialog on a collection owned by a group broke the page a few seconds later, taking the share link and the print button with it.
- fix(Cards): **Filter sliders hold still while you drag** — the bar reshuffled on every move of a range handle, so the slider jumped away under the pointer, and now waits until you let go.
- fix(Cards): **Excluded domains and rarities stand out** — clicking one of those icons a second time to hide its cards showed only a faint red tint, and now draws a line through the icon.
- fix(Trades): **Dead trade requests close themselves** — a request the other side can no longer fill (the copies were traded away, removed, or the list was unshared) now closes right away instead of waiting a week and failing on accept.
- fix(Trades): **Filtered tradelists skip promised copies** — a tradelist built from filters kept offering a copy that was already reserved for someone else.
- fix(Trades): **Moving a card to a group binder unlists it** — a card moved into a shared group collection stayed on your tradelist and was still offered around, even though it had stopped being yours.
- fix(Collection): **Trade changes refresh your cards** — accepting or cancelling a trade left stale copy counts behind for a few minutes.
- fix(Collection): **Exports leave out reserved cards** — exporting a tradelist listed cards that were already promised, which the take-off dialog refuses to sell.
- fix(Collection): **Removing a copy skips promised ones** — the quick-add minus button could pick a copy reserved for a trade and fail, with removable copies sitting right beside it.
- fix(Collection): **Clearer message on a promised card** — deleting a card held by a finished trade told you to cancel that trade, which is not possible, and now points at the sync you still need to resolve.
- fix(Decks): **Correct reason for a locked copy** — the missing cards list always blamed an excluded collection for the padlock icon, even when a copy was actually out on loan or reserved for a trade.

## 2026-08-02

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **Discord trade channels** — mark a channel with `/tradechannel` and the bot answers ordinary posts that name a card with who in your group has it, no command needed.

### Other

- feat(Groups): **Setup nudges on the group page** — a group now tells you when its members can't see a contact method or any list of yours, links to where you fix it, and lets you dismiss the reminder.
- feat(Collection): **Move or remove part of a stack** — right-clicking a card with several copies now lets you pick how many to move to another collection or remove, instead of taking all of them.
- feat(App): **Card, roadmap and changelog titles stay in view** — those three pages now carry the same sticky title bar as the rest of the app, so the title and its actions stay reachable as you scroll.
- feat(App): **Shorter Discord card replies** — a card lookup now shows the image and prices, with the stats and rules text behind a Details button, and flags a ban or errata right away.
- fix(Tournaments): **Submitting right on the deadline** — a deck submitted just after the deadline was saved, but the page reported an error and told you to contact a judge about it.
- fix(App): **Chip markers in Discord card text** — rules text that points a keyword chip left or right showed a stray `>` chip in the bot's reply instead of shaping the chip beside it.
- fix(Decks): **TTS imports keep their zones** — importing a Tabletop Simulator deck that isn't complete no longer tags a main-deck card as your chosen champion or files cards into the sideboard.
- fix(Collection): **Language survives a CSV round trip** — exporting and re-importing a collection dropped the language on cards in anything but English, French, or Simplified Chinese.
- fix(Tournaments): **Lowercased deck codes accepted** — pasting a deck code in lower case for a deck check said it could not be read.
- fix(Collection): **Quick add asks before deleting card details** — undoing an add in the quick-add palette removed a copy outright, so any grade, condition, notes, or links you had recorded on it since adding went with it.
- fix(Tournaments): **Cancelled tournaments stay readable** — cancelling a tournament with pairings broke its pairings tab and every participant's follow link with an error; both now open and show it as cancelled.
- fix(Collection): **Errors on failed list and collection edits** — adding to a list, changing an entry, or reordering lists and collections used to revert with no message, and now says why it failed.
- fix(App): **One message when an action fails** — a failed action raised two toasts, and the vague one usually hid the real reason the server gave.
- fix(App): **Display settings save reliably** — a preference changed in the moment the server answered could be dropped, a background refresh could revert one you had just set, and signing back in left your saved settings unapplied.
- fix(Tournaments): **Edit forms show current values** — the deck-check player and card dialogs, and the tournament settings cards, kept whatever the page loaded with instead of following later updates.
- fix(Groups): **Group settings show current values** — the name, slug, and description fields on the manage page kept their page-load values while the group data refreshed behind them.

## 2026-08-01

### Highlights

- feat(App): **OpenRift Discord bot** — add the bot to your server to look up cards, unfurl deck codes, and quote rules right in chat, with setup steps in the Help Center.
- feat(Collection): **Dynamic rules for organize lists** — organize lists now take the same filter-driven rules wish and trade lists have, so a list can fill itself with every card matching a filter, or every matching copy in your collection.
- feat(Collection): **Price filters in dynamic rules** — list rules can now match by market price on a marketplace you pick (for example, offer every card worth 5 or more).
- fix(Collection): **Value over time matches your collection value** — the chart ended on a different figure than the value beside it, and cards listed under several marketplace entries could take the wrong price.
- fix(Collection): **Collection stats follow your filters** — the totals and estimated value at the top of the stats page counted your whole collection while the charts below them honored the active filters.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Top ten priciest cards** — collection stats now list your most valuable printings instead of a single one, showing two with a button to reveal ten, and the cheapest-printing tile is gone.
- fix(App): **Pull to refresh works again** — pulling down at the top of a page on a phone did nothing, because the app suppressed the browser's own refresh gesture.
- fix(Collection): **Language filter now reachable** — a collection holding only cards in languages you haven't enabled looked empty with no filter to clear, so the Language filter now lists any language it's narrowing by.

## 2026-07-31

### Highlights

- feat(Products): **Product pages load instantly** — a product's card list now arrives with the page instead of appearing once the card data finishes loading, and repeat visits are served from cache.

### Other

- fix(Account): **Old settings could break every page** — a saved setting the app no longer recognizes is now ignored instead of failing the request that loads your settings.

## 2026-07-30

### Other

- fix(App): **Missing help articles** — articles kept behind a feature flag never appeared in the Help Center index, even once the flag was switched on.

## 2026-07-29

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Real artwork for missing images** — printings without a scanned image now show the standard printing's artwork, labeled as placeholder art with badges for anything the borrowed image doesn't show (language, promo stamp, signature).
- fix(Cards): **Sharper scanned card images** — scans now crop tightly to the card (dust on the scanner glass no longer leaves wide white margins) and get a contrast fix that restores true blacks on washed-out scans.

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Decklist API help article** — a new help article explains how registration websites push entrant decklists into a tournament's deck check, from API keys to player claim links.
- feat(Cards): **Cleaner card labels** — the row below each card drops the type icons, shows proper rarity names on hover, and only shows the foil sparkle on commons and uncommons, where foil is a premium variant.
- fix(Cards): **Search inside the More filters** — typing in a filter's search box under More did nothing because the menu grabbed the keystrokes, the text now lands in the box.
- fix(Collection): **Library stays open while you switch** — the "show whole library" button no longer switches itself off every time you move to another collection or list.

## 2026-07-28

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Missing cards straight to a wishlist** — the missing-cards view can now top up one of your existing wishlists, and a new copy button gives a paste-ready wants list for Cardmarket's shopping wizard.
- feat(Collection): **CSV export in more formats** — collections now also export in RiftMana and RiftCore layouts, and wishlists and tradelists can download as CSV in any supported format.
- feat(Decks): **Smarter deck import** — the importer now detects what you pasted (deck list, deck code, TTS string, or a shared-deck link) and can read a deck straight from an uploaded file or a URL containing a deck code.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Cardmarket export for lists** — the list export dialog adds a paste-ready wants list for Cardmarket's shopping wizard, and lists of specific printings can now export too.
- fix(Decks): **Import & replace for local decks** — using it on a deck stored in this browser failed or quietly made a new deck, the cards now land in the deck you started from.

## 2026-07-27

### Highlights

- feat(Tournaments): **Simpler tournament setup** — the create page trims the explanations and groups play mode, pairings (one Swiss BO1/BO3 or FFA choice with an on/off switch), points and decks into compact two-column cards.
- feat(Tournaments): **2v2 teams shown as teams** — match cards, the standings preview and result entry now treat each duo as one entry with a shared score, combined avatar initials, and per-side scoreline buttons.
- feat(App): **A QR for every share link** — collection, list, deck, profile and all-lists links now show a scannable code next to the link, so you can hand one to someone at a table without printing anything first.
- fix(Collection): **Accurate bulk move and dispose** — when a large move or dispose fails partway, the cards that already went through now stay done, with the error covering only the rest.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Easier-to-read trade emails** — update and request emails now sort cards under accepted/declined and wants/offers headings instead of repeating a full sentence per card, and match digests list cards per trade partner.
- feat(Groups): **Join-code QR without the detour** — the invite code on the manage page shows its QR in place instead of behind a dialog, and copying the link now confirms it worked.
- fix(Collection): **No false success on just-added cards** — acting on cards in the brief moment they are still saving now shows a clear message instead of a success that did nothing.
- fix(Trades): **No double-booked copies** — a copy can no longer be claimed by a trade and a loan at the same time when both happen in the same instant.
- fix(Tournaments): **Judges no longer overwrite each other** — two judges deciding on the same deck at once now get a clear conflict instead of silently replacing the first decision.
- fix(Decks): **Copy limit applies from Overflow** — dragging extra copies of a card out of Overflow into the deck no longer sneaks past the 3-copy limit.
- fix(Decks): **Legend swap keeps matching runes** — switching legends now removes only the runes that no longer fit the new domains instead of clearing all of them.
- fix(Cards): **Filter panel edge cases** — a still-active filter now stays visible when it drops out of the options list, and the price slider disables when only one price remains.
- fix(Account): **Flicker while typing your email** — the sign-in and sign-up pages rebuilt the whole card on every keystroke, which made the email field flicker on iOS.
- fix(App): **Dropdown options no longer cut off** — open dropdowns now widen to fit long options instead of clipping them at the button's width.
- fix(Tournaments): **Start date prefill now visible** — the new-tournament page filled the start date in on save, but the field looked empty until now.
- fix(Tournaments): **Quieter match cards for organizers** — pairing fairness stats only appear when something is off, and player rows drop the cryptic standings figure.
- fix(Decks): **Scannable QR on deck share images** — the code was drawn light-on-dark, which some phone cameras refuse to read, and now sits on a light plate.
- fix(App): **QR codes scan more easily** — every code on screen carries more error correction and a proper quiet zone, so they read from further away and at sharper angles.

## 2026-07-26

### Highlights

- feat(Tournaments): **2v2 team tournaments** — pick 2v2 as the play mode, pair players into fixed teams of two, and run Swiss rounds where teams are paired, scored, and ranked together (decks are also checked against the 2v2 banlist).
- feat(Tournaments): **Your deck lives on the tournament page** — every tournament you entered now shows a My deck tile that opens your list, tells you when it is still unsubmitted or a judge asked for changes, and replaces the old "My tournament decks" entry in the account menu.

### Other

- fix(Tournaments): **Pair up players stuck on byes** — the round editor gains a New match zone, so after a drop removes a table its remaining players can be seated against each other again.

## 2026-07-25

### Highlights

- feat(App): **Sorting and grouping stick per page** — cards, collections, decks and promos each remember how you last sorted and grouped them, while a link someone shares still opens in their view without changing your own.
- feat(Collection): **Printable binder QR sheet** — share dialogs can now create a PDF with a QR code to your link, sized to a real card or a 2×2 or 3×3 binder page, so trade partners can scan it out of your binder.
- fix(Cards): **Search ignores punctuation** — "dorans shield" and "doran's shield" now find Doran’s Shield, and searching card text no longer needs the exact apostrophe, dash or accent that the card is printed with.
- fix(App): **Crash on older iPhones** — card, deck and collection pages failed to load on iOS below 17.4, and now work again.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Deck image as a printable PDF** — the deck image export now also downloads as a single A4 page.
- fix(Tournaments): **Own score entry in Swiss events** — players following a Swiss tournament by report link can save their own score again instead of getting an error.
- fix(Decks): **Deck cost ignores overflow** — cards parked in the overflow zone no longer count toward a deck's price, ownership or missing count, and the cost now splits into main deck plus sideboard.

## 2026-07-24

### Highlights

- feat(Products): **Add a product to your collection** — one click on a product page (or the plus on the products list) puts the full card list into a collection of your choice.
- feat(Collection): **Special versions count as owned** — wishlist rules gain a "Count special versions" switch: alt arts, foils, signed and promo copies fill the missing count, while the list keeps asking only for printings matching the filter.
- feat(Trades): **Condition and notes on suggestions** — trade suggestions now show the offered copies' condition (or grade) and public notes, so you know what you'd get before requesting.

### Other

- feat(Products): **Product list grouped by set** — the products page now splits into one section per set, in release order, with cross-set products at the end.
- feat(Collection): **Rule presets for lists** — the rule editor now offers common setups like "one of everything" or "keep a playset, trade the rest" as one-click starting points.
- fix(Trades): **Altered cards no longer match** — copies marked as altered are excluded from automatic trade matching, since a wish means the clean version.
- fix(Collection): **Rule counts say "missing"** — with "Only what I'm missing" on, the rule editor labels its counts as missing instead of matches, since owned copies shrink that number.
- fix(Products): **Simpler card counts** — products where every card is unique now show one count instead of repeating the same number twice.

## 2026-07-23

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Move cards with the quick palette** — the Ctrl+K palette gains a Move mode: pick source and target collections and shift copies by typing card names.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Keep rules per printing** — tradelist keep rules can now count per printing instead of per card, so each printing keeps its own playset.
- feat(Trades): **Preview cards on hover** — hovering a trade suggestion now shows a large card image beside the list, like the deck builder.
- feat(Collection): **Search the move dialogs** — moving cards to a collection or entries to another list now offers a filter box, so the target is quick to find.
- fix(Collection): **Promos kept over plain foils** — tradelist keep rules now treat stamped printings (promos) as nicer than unmarked ones, so they stay in the keep pile instead of the offer pile.
- feat(Collection): **Marker and channel filters everywhere** — collections, shared collections, and lists now offer the promo marker and distribution channel filters known from the card browser.
- fix(Cards): **Clear filters keeps your language** — the clear-filters button now resets every filter except the language selection, so you stay in your chosen language.

## 2026-07-21

### Other

- fix(Cards): **Mobile card-detail navigation crash** — swiping through cards on a phone no longer crashes when the list changed while the detail view was open.

## 2026-07-20

### Highlights

- fix(Tournaments): **Tournament pages for players** — opening a tournament as a player no longer shows an error screen, and a pending join request no longer breaks the pairings and standings for everyone.

### Other

- fix(Tournaments): **Deleted tournament links** — an old link to a removed tournament now shows a proper 404 page instead of an error screen.

## 2026-07-17

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Sideboards hold 10 cards** — the sideboard limit is now 10 instead of 8, in the builder hints, the deck legality check, and the registration sheet.
- feat(Cards): **Format-specific ban display** — cards banned only in 2v2 now carry a "2v2 Ban" ribbon and stay usable in the deck builder, while full constructed bans keep the red banned treatment.
- fix(Rules): **Tidier rules toolbar** — the toolbar background now reaches the screen edges on phones instead of stopping short, and the changes toggle is a compact icon button.
- fix(Rules): **Readable rule diffs** — comparing rule versions no longer shows garbled characters or misplaced highlights, and rules whose wording never changed are no longer flagged as changed.

## 2026-07-16

### Highlights

- feat(Tournaments): **Redesigned tournament pages** — the tournament page now opens with an event header and leads with the live round and a standings podium, and the players, pairings, standings, and staff pages match the same look.
- feat(Tournaments): **Swiss 1v1 rounds** — tournaments can now pair head-to-head Swiss rounds (best of 1 or 3) with configurable win, draw, and bye points, automatic byes, and strong rematch avoidance.
- feat(Tournaments): **Player regions** — assign each player a region: pairings avoid same-region matchups and the standings add a per-region leaderboard.
- feat(Tournaments): **Events pages redesign** — the next tournament gets a hero card with legend art from submitted decks, and past events line up on a timeline with winner callouts and participant avatars, on the tournaments page and in groups.
- feat(Groups): **Redesigned group page** — a new group header with card art and member avatars, one trades hub for matches and in-progress trades, and an activity feed that folds big trade sessions into a single entry.
- feat(Trades): **Redesigned group trades page** — a summary band shows what needs your action and the value at stake, trades waiting on you come first, and members' shared lists appear as cards with contact info.
- feat(Groups): **A friendlier groups overview** — groups now show as tiles with member photos, shared-list counts, and a clear marker on any group that needs your attention.
- feat(Tournaments): **Enter just your own score** — players on the result link can now save their own game points next to their name; the pod completes once everyone has entered theirs.
- feat(Tournaments): **Live round updates** — while a round is open, the results page refreshes itself, so scores saved by anyone appear for everyone without reloading.

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Fixed tables for players** — pin a player to a physical table and their match is placed there each round; pairings stay untouched, and if two pinned players meet, the round notes who moves.
- feat(Tournaments): **Region variety across rounds** — on region-aware events, pairings now also avoid serving a player the same opposing region round after round.
- feat(Tournaments): **Fresh seating orders in pods** — the player order shown on each pod is now the seating order at the table, arranged so nobody keeps the same neighbors or turn order as in earlier rounds.
- fix(Tournaments): **Region avoidance from round 1 in pods** — 3/4-player pod events with regions on no longer pair the first round fully at random; same-region pods are avoided from the start.
- feat(Groups): **Date-anchored activity feed** — each day in the group activity feed now gets the same calendar date tile as the events timeline, replacing the Today and Yesterday headers.
- feat(Tournaments): **Podium on the shared standings link** — the standings page you share with players and spectators now leads with the top three, matching the tournament page.
- feat(Groups): **Redesigned group collections page** — pooled collections are now tiles with a fan of their own card art, and each member's shared collections list openly under their name with cover thumbnails, no unfolding needed.
- feat(Groups): **Redesigned members page** — join requests stand out in a highlighted approval band, and each member is now a card showing their role, join date, cards traded, and what they share.
- feat(Groups): **Ownership transfer in group settings** — handing the group to another member now happens on the Manage page with a member picker and confirmation, instead of hiding in a member menu.
- feat(Groups): **Tournaments first on the group overview** — the tile row now leads with tournaments, so the next event is the first thing you see.
- feat(Tournaments): **Warning before overwriting results** — the pod result form now says when someone else saved scores while you were editing, with a button to load the latest values.
- fix(Designer): **Card designer fits on phones** — the editor and live preview now stack within the screen instead of running off the right edge.
- fix(App): **Phone layout cleanup** — the sets list, card pages, group join-code controls, tournament status banners, and deck value stats no longer clip or crush their text on narrow screens.
- fix(Tournaments): **Regions required before pairing** — on region-aware events, rounds can no longer be generated while active players lack a region; the participants page now flags those players and offers a one-click Set region button.
- fix(Tournaments): **Staff invite links fit on phones** — the invite link no longer gets squeezed to a sliver beside the Copy button on a narrow screen.
- fix(Products): **Card art stays inside its band** — the fanned cover art on product tiles is now cropped at the band edge, so card corners no longer overlap the product name below.
- feat(Cards): **Clearer narrowed-search indicator** — when search is limited to certain fields, the "in:" chip now stays visible even with an empty search box and has its own remove button to search all fields again.
- fix(Cards): **Filter chips no longer detach on mobile** — the active-filter chips now stay attached to the search bar instead of sometimes floating below a gap with uneven spacing.
- fix(Groups): **Accurate tournament tile hint** — the group overview now says how many open tournaments you play in, instead of a stale deck-list count that missed some events.
- fix(Tournaments): **Readable standings on phones** — the mobile standings are now a compact ranked list showing wins, opponent score, and game points, instead of a cramped wall of numbers.

## 2026-07-15

### Highlights

- feat(Products): **Card-art product tiles** — the products page now shows each product with a fan of its signature cards, a short description, and the card counts.
- feat(Decks): **Any number of copies** — cards whose text allows more than 3 copies of themselves now build and validate correctly, with the add buttons and drag limits following the printed rule.
- feat(Cards): **See which products contain a card** — every card page now has a "Found in" list showing the sealed products and promo channels the selected printing comes in, with how many copies.
- feat(Cards): **Chinese cards now use the printed code** — Simplified Chinese printings show as SC, matching what Riot prints on the card, and saved links and language filters carry over on their own.

### Other

- fix(App): **Sidebar fold button on landscape phones** — the sidebar can be collapsed again on wider phone screens, the fold button lines up with page titles, and top bar content clears the notch on iPhones.
- fix(Tournaments): **Fairer three-player pod rotation** — the pairing engine kept seating the same low-scoring players in three-player pods; it now rotates that duty across the whole field.
- fix(Cards): **Price filter on non-English promos** — the promo price filter was hidden on every language except English, even for cards that had prices, and now appears whenever there are prices to filter on.
- fix(Products): **No more dimming for unowned cards** — product pages no longer gray out cards you don't own, your collection now shows only in the card detail pane and the owned filters.

## 2026-07-14

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **Cardmarket export for trades** — each trade partner now has an export that copies your agreed cards as a plain list, ready to paste into Cardmarket's shopping wizard for pricing.

### Other

- fix(Collection): **List text pastes into Cardmarket** — the copied list text now writes "2x" instead of "2×", so Cardmarket's import recognizes the lines.
- fix(Collection): **Share menu renamed** — the list menu entry is now "Share" instead of "Share link", since it also covers the text and image options.

## 2026-07-13

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **List view for decks** — a new list toggle on the deck overview shows every card in dense rows (count, energy, ownership, price, set code) that you can sort by name, energy, price, rarity, or how many you still own.
- feat(Decks): **Missing cards, ready to buy** — each missing card now shows its cost inline (copies × price), links its name to the card page, and has a button to buy it on your marketplace.

### Other

- feat(Decks): **Missing count on the deck list** — every deck in the overview now shows how many cards you still need to build it, the same number as the deck's ownership panel.
- feat(Decks): **Missing card count in value tile** — the deck value card now shows how many cards you still need alongside the estimated cost to buy them.
- fix(Decks): **Reserved cards no longer count as owned** — cards you have reserved for an outgoing trade are left out of a deck's buildable stock, so the missing count reflects what you can actually build.
- fix(Collection): **Copies filter narrows the others** — filtering by copies owned now dims the other filter options to match, and the copies slider range follows your owned-status selection.
- fix(Cards): **Battlefield thumbnails no longer cropped** — landscape Battlefield art was cropped to a center strip in card lists, tables, and stats, and now rotates to fill the frame.

## 2026-07-12

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Clear your Inbox** — the Inbox can't be deleted, but its menu now has a clear action that removes every card in one go.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Remove a copy without expanding** — each variant in the card's box popover now has a minus next to its plus, removing from the same collection the plus adds to.
- feat(Collection): **Clearer copies list** — the "Copies of…" list now names each copy by its printing (variant details and rarity) and summarizes what it actually records: condition, altered, notes, links, and loan status, instead of a bare set code.
- feat(Collection): **Reset collections in one step** — a new profile danger-zone action removes every card, keeps only your Inbox, and cleans up lists that end up empty.
- feat(Cards): **Color-coded language chips** — a printing's language now shows as a colored chip (a blue EN, a red ZH) so you can spot it at a glance instead of reading the code.
- fix(Collection): **Worth counts only your cards** — the "worth" total counted shared group collections too, so it stayed non-zero after you cleared your own cards, and now counts only yours.
- fix(Cards): **Full-size rune symbols** — the rune icons in card text carried an invisible margin inside the image and rendered smaller than intended; they now fill their full space.
- fix(Collection): **Clearer wait in remove dialogs** — while the remove and take-off-tradelist dialogs check your lists, the confirm button now shows a spinner with "Checking your lists" instead of staying greyed out with no hint.
- fix(Cards): **Energy circles on the text line** — the numbered energy-cost circle in card text hung noticeably lower than the rune symbols next to it and now lines up with them.
- fix(Cards): **Placeholder art in the printing fan** — printings without a photo now fan out as proper placeholder cards (with a small Promo stamp where it applies) instead of blank gray boxes.
- fix(App): **Broken images look like missing ones** — a card image that fails to load (missing on the server, network hiccup) now shows the same fallback as a card that has no image, everywhere images appear: placeholder art in the browser and on card pages, icon tiles in lists and deck previews, or simply no thumbnail. No more empty boxes or browser broken-image icons.

## 2026-07-11

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Filter by card tags** — a new Tags filter groups the tags printed on cards by region, champion, and species; tag chips on card pages now apply it directly.
- fix(App): **Enter confirms dialogs** — pressing Enter in confirmation and edit dialogs now triggers the main button (save, create, remove) instead of doing nothing.

### Other

- fix(Groups): **Tournaments reachable for all members** — the group overview now shows the Tournaments tile to every member, so group tournaments are no longer hidden from players without an admin role or a submitted deck.
- fix(Cards): **Rune symbols match the cards** — rune icons in card text now show the domain's colored emblem instead of a filled disc, matching how they look on the printed cards.
- fix(Collection): **On-loan count in the card strip** — the loan marker moved from the card image into the strip above it, so it no longer covers the art and stays visible while hovering a card with several printings.
- feat(App): **Cleaner card-grid controls** — the strip above cards now looks the same on every page: counts and info chips lose their grey boxes and the "×" prefix, and the deck editor gets remove on the left, add on the right.
- feat(Collection): **Prices in quick add** — the quick-add palette now shows each printing's market price next to it, so you can see value while adding.
- fix(App): **Destructive button hover in dark mode** — red buttons like Delete gave no visual feedback under the cursor in dark mode and now lighten on hover.
- fix(App): **Search clear button spacing** — the × that clears a search box sat nearly flush against the right edge and now keeps a small gap.
- fix(Decks): **Search bar focus ring** — the ring around the deck search box was cut off at the top by the sticky title bar and now shows fully.
- fix(Trades): **Clearer trade value wording** — "You'd get ≈X" on trade headers read like cash coming to you; it now says "cards worth ≈X" to make clear it's the value of the cards.
- fix(App): **Consistent tile highlighting** — clickable tiles (groups, sets, tournaments, help, stats, decks) now share one hover style and show a focus ring when navigating by keyboard.
- fix(App): **Subtler focus rings** — inputs, buttons, and toggles now mark keyboard focus with a thinner 2px ring instead of the thick 3px halo, matching the rest of the app.
- fix(App): **One corner radius everywhere** — cards, tiles, dialogs, drawers, and pickers now share the form controls' corner radius, fixing mismatched corners in popover pickers.
- fix(Collection): **Quick add search reset on first card** — adding the first card to an empty collection no longer clears the quick-add search box mid-session.
- fix(App): **Consistent page-title dashes** — Google rewrote our title suffix with its own dash style, so search results mixed two kinds of dashes; titles now use the plain hyphen everywhere.
- fix(App): **Content flush under the title bar** — cards and content no longer sit tight against the sticky page header, so their top edge stops fading into it.

## 2026-07-10

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Deck-check API hint in settings** — tournament settings now show the tournament ID and link to the Deck check tab, so pushing decklists in from another tool is easier to find.
- fix(Tournaments): **Deck-check pushes before start** — pushing decklists in from another tool no longer fails with a conflict error while the tournament is still in setup, so decks can be handed in before it begins.
- fix(Groups): **Smart list counts everywhere** — dynamic wishlists and tradelists that held cards showed 0 items on member pages, the share picker, and public profile lists, and now show their real size.
- fix(Groups): **Missing in-progress trades on member pages** — a member's page hid trades whose cards were already reserved, and now lists every trade in progress with that member.
- fix(Collection): **Add popup on scrolled cards** — clicking a card's count pill after scrolling down a collection jumped the grid to the top instead of opening the variants and add popup. The grid now stays put, the popup opens where you clicked, and clicking the same pill again closes it.

## 2026-07-09

### Other

- fix(Groups): **Bulk box playset filter** — filtering a group bulk box by copies owned now counts your full personal playset across every variant (foil and normal together), so a card you already own enough of no longer shows under "cards I'm missing".

## 2026-07-08

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **Trades grouped by person** — the Trades page now stacks your trades and possible trades under each member with a running value estimate, plus bulk Accept all, Decline all, Cancel all, and Request all buttons.
- feat(Products): **Product catalog** — the new Products page lists official products with every card inside.
- feat(Collection): **Card lending** — right-click a card in your collection to lend it to a friend: it stays owned but stops counting for decks and trades until it's back, and the new Lending page tracks who has what, including cards you're borrowing.
- fix(Trades): **Wishlist rule filters now limit matches** — a dynamic card want no longer matches printings its filters exclude (like overnumbered variants), and "only what I'm missing" no longer counts such copies as owned.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Bullet in punctuation helpers** — the card text toolbar now has a bullet button alongside quotes, dashes, and ellipses.
- feat(App): **Ambient background color** — the soft color washes from the landing page now carry through the whole app in a quieter form, in both light and dark mode.
- fix(App): **Update prompt loop after releases** — for a while after a release, the app could repeatedly show the "new version available" prompt and reload on every page change; it now updates once and settles.
- fix(App): **Recover from rare blank-page crashes** — a rare crash that used to leave a dead white page now reloads the app once automatically.
- fix(Groups): **Rule-based list counts on the group trades page** — dynamic wishlists and tradelists showed 0 items there even when they held cards; they now show their real size.

## 2026-07-07

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Track each copy's condition** — right-click any owned card to record its condition or professional grade, an altered flag, notes, and photo links; imports and exports keep conditions, and removing a copy with details asks first.
- feat(Cards): **Multi-type card support** — cards with more than one type (like the new Unit Gear cards) now count for every type they carry: filters, grouping, deck rules, and copy limits all recognize both, and the card shows a glyph for each.
- feat(App): **New body typeface** — everyday text across the app, and the generated share and deck images, now use Hanken Grotesk, a warmer face that reads softer than the old default.
- fix(App): **Constant background redraw on card pages** — a hidden render loop kept the card, collection, and deck pages working nonstop even when idle, draining CPU and battery for nothing.

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Save your tournament deck to your decks** — a new button on your tournament deck copies the handed-in list into a regular deck, so you can keep building on it after the event.
- feat(Cards): **Punctuation helpers when submitting cards** — the contribute form's text fields gained quick buttons for curly quotes, apostrophes, em dashes, and ellipses, and flavor text now shows a live preview.
- feat(Collection): **Live match counts on list rules** — each dynamic wishlist or tradelist rule now shows how many cards it wants or copies it offers, plus a combined total once you stack several.
- fix(App): **Hairline gap under the header** — at some browser zoom levels a thin line of scrolling content peeked through between the header and the sticky bars below it.
- fix(App): **Friendlier landing headline** — the tagline now describes the app for you and your playgroup instead of claiming the fastest collection tracker.
- fix(App): **Clipped toolbar focus rings** — the highlight ring around the search box and toolbar buttons on the card pages no longer gets cut off along the top.
- fix(App): **Clearer navigation highlights** — the current page in the header is now marked by bold text instead of a filled pill, so it no longer blends into the hover highlight next to it.

## 2026-07-06

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Multiple rules per tradelist** — tradelists can now stack up to 10 dynamic rules, and both wishlists and tradelists let you pick how overlapping rules combine.
- feat(Collection): **Replace on import** — importing into a collection that already has copies now asks whether to add to it or replace everything with the import.
- feat(App): **Redesigned landing page** — a fanned hand of real cards takes center stage: hover to tilt them, click to collect them all, with sharper copy and new angular buttons.
- feat(App): **New display typeface** — page titles, section headings, big stat numbers, and the OpenRift wordmark now use Chakra Petch, giving the app its own voice instead of the default font everywhere.
- feat(App): **Sharper, angular look** — corners are tighter across the app, filled buttons carry a signature corner cut (delete buttons now solid red with the same shape), and tiles share one consistent card style.
- feat(App): **Friendlier empty screens** — pages without content yet (decks, collections, lists, search results) now show a fan of card outlines with clear next steps.
- feat(Decks): **Try a sample deck** — the empty decks page offers a ready-made Azir deck that opens in the builder with one click, no account needed.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Overlapping wish rules add up** — a card matched by several wishlist rules is now wanted once per rule; switch a list to "highest rule wins" to get the old behavior.
- feat(Collection): **Special copies kept first** — trade rules now hold back foil, signed, and promo copies before plain ones when deciding what to offer.
- feat(App): **Expanded "Why OpenRift" article** — more on the story behind the app, what the other trackers do well, and a comparison table with its own trading and groups section.
- feat(App): **Refreshed interface components** — buttons now respond to hover everywhere, dialogs got subtly lighter surfaces, and mobile drawers track your finger with snappier fling-to-close.
- feat(Decks): **Placeholders for missing key cards** — deck tiles now show labeled dashed cards for a legend or champion you haven't picked yet, instead of a generic icon.
- feat(Decks): **Local decks flag when to sign in** — building a deck while signed out now clearly says it lives only on this device, with a sign-in link to keep it and use it anywhere.
- feat(App): **Landing feature previews** — the feature list now shows mini previews of the real app (price compare, deck rows, trade matches) instead of icon tiles.
- fix(Account): **Trade contacts button alignment** — the Save and Add buttons next to a contact entry now match the input height instead of sitting slightly shorter.
- fix(Cards): **Readable mobile card header** — the card detail title bar on phones now sits on a frosted, card-tinted background, so the title stays legible over the card art instead of floating on top of it.
- fix(Decks): **Copy limits in deck codes** — exporting more copies of a card than deck codes support (12 main deck, 3 sideboard) now exports the maximum and warns, instead of silently losing the card.
- fix(Tournaments): **Organizations survive owner deletion** — deleting your account now hands your organization to a co-owner or manager instead of erasing it for everyone.
- fix(Groups): **Old group links keep working** — renaming a group now forwards its previous address, so bookmarks and trade emails from recent days still open it.
- fix(Collection): **Exact CSV re-import** — importing your own export no longer drops token cards like Buff, and promos with several markers now match exactly.
- fix(App): **Share links stay out of search** — pages opened via share links now ask search engines not to index them, while link previews in chats keep working.

## 2026-07-05

### Other

- fix(App): **Cleaner message punctuation** — error messages, toasts, and the What's new list now read as plain sentences instead of dash-heavy phrasing.
- fix(Decks): **Deck codes for special printings** — exporting a deck code no longer fails when the deck pins a printing deck codes don't support yet (like a Founders alt art), it encodes the default printing or lists the skipped cards instead.
- fix(Decks): **Locked zones reject dropped cards** — dragging a card from the browser onto a zone shown as locked (like the sideboard on a Custom-Region deck) no longer adds a copy there.
- fix(Decks): **One battlefield pick in plans** — the deck plan for Custom-Region decks now offers a single battlefield slot instead of three, and the too-many-battlefields warning explains itself in plain words.
- fix(Decks): **Share dialog mentions your Plan** — the deck share dialog now says the link includes your Plan (strategy, mulligans, matchup notes), so nothing goes public unexpectedly.
- fix(Decks): **Signed-out decks survive bad storage** — decks built while signed out now load even when the browser's saved data is partially damaged, keeping every intact deck instead of failing the deck list.
- fix(Tournaments): **Hosted events survive account deletion** — deleting your account now removes you as host instead of erasing the whole tournament, so participants keep their results.
- fix(Tournaments): **No false region warning in deck checks** — Custom-Region deck checks no longer flag every deck with "Pick at least one region".
- fix(Tournaments): **Email never used as player name** — joining an event without an account name now shows the part before the @ of your email, never the full address.
- fix(Cards): **Bad links can't crash the catalog** — a card-browser link with an unknown grouping or sort value now falls back to the defaults instead of showing an error page.

## 2026-07-03

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Custom-Region rules update** — signature cards need their champion in the deck copy for copy, only one battlefield is played, there is no sideboard, runes of every domain are allowed, and ban badges no longer show.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **See which list matched** — each possible-trade row now names the wishlist or tradelist of yours that produced it.
- fix(Decks): **Custom-Region battlefield count** — the deck builder claimed 3 battlefields were needed while the format plays exactly 1, so all counters and hints now say 1 and a full deck reads as complete.
- fix(Decks): **Dragging onto a wrong zone keeps the card** — dropping a deck card onto a zone it can't go in (like a unit onto Runes or Battlefields) now leaves it in place, instead of removing a copy.
- fix(Collection): **All printings in list detail panes** — the detail panel on wishlists and tradelists (your own and ones shared with you) now lists every printing of a card, not just the ones on the list.
- fix(Trades): **Per-copy price on suggestions** — a suggestion priced the full amount you wished even when fewer copies were available, so it now shows the price per copy with the wished and available counts beside it.

## 2026-07-02

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **One filter bar everywhere** — the slim filter bar is now the standard filter layout on every screen size, replacing the filter sidebar, the fold-out panel, and the compact-filters setting.
- feat(Cards): **Pick your top-level filters** — decide per filter whether it sits in front or waits under "More", replacing filter hiding (previously hidden filters now show up in More).
- feat(Cards): **Contribute cards in the app** — submit a missing card, a correction, or an image right from the app and send it straight to review, no GitHub account needed.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Clearer filter-bar toggles** — domain and rarity toggles show their names and match counts next to the icons whenever the bar has room for them on one row, and excluded toggles drop the extra red border.
- feat(Trades): **Price estimates on trade rows** — in-progress trades and possible-trade suggestions now show their estimated value at your favorite marketplace.
- feat(Cards): **Search scope stays visible** — when "search in" is limited to certain fields, the search box now shows that scope next to your query, so a forgotten narrow scope doesn't look like broken search.
- feat(Collection): **Friendlier first visit** — an empty collection now opens the whole card library so your first cards are one tap away, and a dismissible guide explains the toolbar controls.
- feat(App): **See features before signing in** — Collection, Groups, and Tournaments now stay in the menu when signed out, and opening one explains the feature with a quick way to sign in or sign up.
- feat(Cards): **Hide the grouped column** — in table view, grouping by set, type, or rarity now drops that column, since every group header already spells out its value.
- feat(Collection): **Tradelists keep your nicer copies** — when a tradelist rule keeps a set number per card and offers the rest, it now protects your rarest, foil, and special-art copies and offers the plainer duplicates first, instead of choosing by the order copies were added.
- feat(Collection): **Rules start in your languages** — a new dynamic wishlist or tradelist rule pre-fills its language filter with your preferred languages, still editable per rule.
- fix(Collection): **Playset count mode** — the completion count mode on the stats page is now labeled Playset instead of Copies, matching what it counts.
- fix(Collection): **Group-visibility button works again** — the people icon in a list's title bar did nothing when the list had cards on it, and now opens the group visibility dialog.
- fix(Collection): **No overlapping cards after switching lists** — switching between wishlists or tradelists could stack the card rows on top of each other until the window was resized, and the grid now lays them out correctly right away.
- fix(Collection): **No zero value in the top bar** — a collection worth nothing no longer shows a 0 price next to its title.
- fix(Collection): **Lists match the card browser** — clicking a card in a wishlist or tradelist now tints its tile so you can see which one the detail pane is showing, the up and down arrow keys cycle through that card's printings, and the grouping now follows the group-by control instead of always grouping by set, just like the card browser and collection.
- fix(Collection): **Select all deletes whole stacks** — in card view, using Select all then Dispose left copies behind for any card you own in more than one printing, and now it removes every copy under each card.
- fix(Trades): **Compact trade-match rows** — each possible-trade row is shorter now, with the price and accepted trade type on one line instead of three stacked lines.
- fix(Collection): **Open lists with older rules** — a wishlist or tradelist whose dynamic rule was saved before a recent filter was added failed to open, and those lists now load again.
- fix(Collection): **Labeled rule chips on cards** — a card added by a dynamic list rule now shows a "Rule" chip on its corner instead of a bare sparkle icon, matching the table view.
- fix(Collection): **Remove excluded copies one at a time** — a tradelist rule showed the copies you excluded from its auto-offers as a bare count with a single clear-all button, and now names each excluded copy with its own remove button.
- fix(Collection): **Cleaner dynamic-rule filters** — the "has any" options for markers, tags, keywords, and the rest now sit inside their filter's picker, matching the card browser, instead of cluttering the Add filter menu.
- fix(Collection): **Import name field spacing** — the new-collection name box on the import screen sat flush against its label, and now has a proper gap.
- fix(Groups): **Readable overview rows** — the recent-activity entries and the in-progress trade rows now wrap to a second line instead of cutting off, so long card names stay legible on phones.
- fix(Trades): **Trade a card offered by a rule** — offering or accepting a card your tradelist shares through a dynamic rule failed with a "0 copies available" error, and those copies now count as available.
- fix(Trades): **Trade matches on small screens** — the possible-trades rows stack neatly on phones instead of cramming the card, price, member, and button onto one line, and the price now reads "Price".
- fix(Cards): **Placeholder for art-less cards** — a card thumbnail with no image (like a printing we haven't added art for yet) now shows a faded rarity mark tinted in the card's domain color, instead of a blank grey box.
- fix(Cards): **All printings in the detail pane** — the detail panel now lists every printing of a card, not just the ones left after your set, search, and rarity filters (still scoped to your chosen languages).
- fix(Groups): **Group matches with older list rules** — a group page could fail to load when a shared wishlist or tradelist used a dynamic rule saved before a recent filter was added, and those rules now evaluate correctly again.

## 2026-07-01

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Deck image in the Export menu** — download the shareable deck picture from a new Image tab in Export, for any deck, without turning on link sharing first.
- feat(Cards): **Filter by "has any" or "none"** — require a card to have at least one (or zero) markers, custom tags, distribution channels, or keywords, without naming specific values. The old Promo filter is now "Has any marker", and dynamic list rules get the same options (including supertypes) so a saved rule stays correct as the catalog grows.

### Other

- feat(Cards): **Filter by keyword** — a new Keywords filter in the More menu narrows to cards with a given ability keyword (Shield, Ambush, and the rest), alongside its has-any / none options.
- feat(Cards): **Simpler size filter** — Size moved into the More menu as a single "Oversized" toggle (require oversized, require standard, or off), instead of a separate size picker.
- feat(Collection): **Clearer list sharing** — sharing a public link and choosing which groups can see a list are now two focused dialogs that link to each other, instead of one crowded panel.
- feat(Collection): **Dynamic-rule status on lists** — a wishlist or tradelist with active dynamic rules now highlights its rules button and shows how many are running.
- fix(Account): **Trade-status email toggle** — the profile setting for trade status update emails didn't save, so opting out never took effect, and now your choice persists.
- fix(Decks): **Deck image layout** — the shared deck picture now groups the deck into sideboard, battlefield, and rune sections that grow to fill the space, lists the main and sideboard counts separately with the deck's domain icons, and centers each card in its tile.
- fix(Decks): **Proxies hidden for empty decks** — the Proxies button did nothing on a deck with no cards, and now it only appears once the deck has cards to print.

## 2026-06-30

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Build decks without signing in** — start a deck right away, save it on this device, and import a deck code while logged out; sign in later to keep the ones you pick.
- feat(Groups): **In-progress trades on the overview** — the group page now lists the trades you're waiting to finish, so a request you sent or a deal awaiting hand-off no longer disappears until it's complete.
- feat(Collection): **Drop a card from a list rule** — a card a dynamic rule added can now be excluded so it stays off the list, and you can put it back from the rule editor.
- feat(Cards): **Exclude values from filters** — click any filter value a second time to exclude it (sets, types, rarities, domains, and the rest, in the dropdowns too), hiding it from the catalog, with each exclusion shown as a chip you can clear.

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Follow-only tournament link** — share a view-only follow-along link that shows rounds and standings but cannot enter results, alongside the reporting link, and both now have a scannable QR code.
- feat(Tournaments): **Change a tournament's group** — link, switch, or unlink an event's group right in settings, instead of being locked to the choice made at creation.
- feat(App): **Link previews on WordPress** — deck, collection, list, and profile share links now unfurl to their preview image when posted on a WordPress site (via oEmbed).
- fix(Tournaments): **Group open-tournaments count** — the group page counted a finished tournament left unmarked as still open, and now matches the events list by counting only upcoming and in-progress ones.
- fix(Cards): **Standard filter shows as active** — setting only the Standard toggle trimmed the grid without lighting the filter indicator or offering a clear-all, and it now appears as a removable chip like every other filter.
- fix(App): **Stale tab recovers after an update** — a tab left open across a new release could silently stop refreshing (e.g. a deck-check page mid-event), and now reloads itself to pick up the new version.

## 2026-06-29

### Highlights

- feat(Collection): **Dynamic lists** — wish and trade lists can now fill themselves from saved rules (a playset of every card, every surplus common you own beyond two playsets, and so on), staying up to date automatically instead of being added by hand. A wish list can stack several rules and combines their matches.
- fix(Collection): **Shared list links open again** — opening someone's shared wishlist or tradelist returned an authorization error for signed-out visitors, and the public share page now loads for everyone.

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Simpler tournament setup** — pairings and deck collection are now independent and each optional, and judges can check any lists you collect without a separate deck-check switch, so you can run pods, a deck-only check, a plain roster, or any mix.
- feat(Tournaments): **Add staff from your group or a link** — pick organizers or judges from your group and roster, or share a per-role invite link anyone takes by confirming while signed in.
- feat(Tournaments): **Jump to a player's deck** — once a participant has a submitted deck, their row gets a button straight to it, next to the actions menu.
- feat(Tournaments): **Add players from the top bar** — the participants page moved its "Add player" button into the top bar, where it opens a dialog asking for the name, and the old field became a player search.
- feat(Tournaments): **Manage decks from the list** — a per-row menu on the deck-check list lets you withdraw, restore, or delete a player's deck without opening it.
- feat(Tournaments): **Dropped players flagged on decks** — a dropped player's deck now shows a status badge and dims in the deck-check list, so judges can see the list is kept but the player is out.
- feat(Tournaments): **Tidier deck-check entry header** — a player's contact, reviewer, sharing, and linked account now sit in a compact labeled grid, and each sharing item is marked allowed or withheld with a check or cross.
- feat(Tournaments): **Change a tournament's host** — the host is now editable in settings, so you can hand an event to an organization you belong to or take it back as a personal host instead of being locked to the choice made at creation.
- feat(Tournaments): **Organization staff shown on events** — an org-hosted event's staff page now lists the organization's owners and managers as organizers, so it's clear who can manage it even without an explicit staff grant.
- feat(Tournaments): **Claim a spot with a link** — every player you add gets a claim link (copy it from the participant menu) that ties their spot, and any deck, to their OpenRift account, now working for events without deck check too.
- feat(Tournaments): **Mark checked fills the ticks** — marking a deck checked now ticks every card as found, and re-opening it clears them again so a re-check starts clean (flagging an issue leaves your ticks as they were).
- feat(Cards): **Standard-only filter** — the More filters now have a Standard toggle that narrows the catalog to plain printings, hiding foils, signed, promo, and premium-finish versions.
- fix(Tournaments): **Deck link works without self-registration** — with sign-ups closed, the shared deck link now accepts decks from anyone who claimed their spot and points everyone else to their claim link, instead of going dead.
- fix(Tournaments): **Run org-hosted events** — pairings, standings, and round running now open for an organization's owners, managers, and staff, and participants can follow along, instead of failing to load for everyone including the host.
- fix(Tournaments): **Clearer deck-check progress** — the overview tile and deck-check list now show the same numbers, how many decks are approved and how many are checked.
- fix(Tournaments): **Overview and settings refresh after a round** — running, finalizing, or rerolling a round now updates the current-round tile and locks the pairing setup right away, instead of showing stale values until you reload.
- fix(Tournaments): **Set a member to Judge** — changing an organization member's role to Judge now takes effect, instead of silently doing nothing.
- fix(Tournaments): **No more stuck deck-check page** — opening a tournament's deck check without judge access now shows a short notice, instead of a loading spinner that never finishes.
- fix(Tournaments): **Re-issue a claim link** — unlinking the wrong account from a player's spot used to leave it stuck, so you can now re-issue its claim link for the correct player to claim.

## 2026-06-28

### Highlights

- feat(Tournaments): **One home for your events** — the new Tournaments area runs pod pairings and standings, collects player decklists, and lets judges check them, all on one event hosted by you or an organization, with times in your own timezone and multi-day scheduling.
- feat(Collection): **Import CSVs into lists** — both a list's own Import and the Import / Export page now accept any supported CSV (OpenRift, Piltover Archive, RiftCore, RiftMana) and can send the cards to a list instead of your owned collection, keeping each card's finish and art variant.
- feat(Collection): **One menu for variants and collections** — the count box on a card now opens a single menu listing each variant with the collections your copies live in, where you can add or remove copies per collection (or add to another collection) right there. Removing a copy that could come from several places opens this menu instead of chaining through separate pickers.
- feat(Cards): **Oversized cards** — cards that also come in a physically larger print are now tracked as their own variety, so you can filter by size and collect the oversized version separately from the standard one.

### Other

- feat(Tournaments): **Dashboard overview** — the event page now opens on a tile dashboard linking to participants, pairings, standings, decks, and staff instead of a tab bar, with a consistent look across those lists.
- feat(Collection): **Collapsible variants in the card menu** — when a card has several variants, the menu lists just the variants and expands one to show its collections on click, opening on the variant you came in on.
- feat(Collection): **Plain text lists on the import page** — the Import / Export page now accepts a plain text "quantity cardname" list, not just CSV exports, matching how list import already worked.
- feat(Decks): **Text deck format leads import and export** — the plain text list is now the default tab and comes first when importing or exporting a deck, ahead of the deck code.
- feat(Decks): **Custom printings are clearer** — the deck overview now rings cards that use a pinned printing, and the card menu has a "Use default printing" option to drop the pin and fall back to the standard art.
- feat(Cards): **Tidier compact filter bar** — the Stats button now reads its value (like "Energy 1–3") when one range is set, the active-filters strip is hidden while the compact bar is up (that bar already shows every active filter), and a clear-all button next to the filter settings resets every filter in one click.
- fix(App): **Smarter card-name search** — the card search in the importer, deck import, and deck check now ignores punctuation and word order, so "annie dark" finds "Annie, Dark Child".
- fix(Collection): **Tell printings apart while importing** — the importer's catalog search now shows a thumbnail, tags non-English printings (like `[ZH]`), and previews the full card on hover (reliably, even after an imageless result), matching the variant picker beside it, so two same-looking entries are no longer indistinguishable.
- fix(Collection): **Clearer import review counts** — the collection and deck import summaries now split rows into ready, "to verify" (a best guess that still imports), and "need attention", and the per-row icons match those buckets, so the warning marks line up with the count.
- fix(Collection): **Tidier variant menu layout** — the variant-and-collections menu now lines its counts and add/remove buttons into clean columns and sets each variant off as a quiet header, and a menu opened with the remove shortcut shows only remove controls.
- fix(Cards): **Group by set lists main sets first** — grouping the card grid (or table) by set now shows the main sets ahead of the supplemental ones, matching the filter sidebar order, including the cards shown on the very first page load before the grid finishes loading.
- fix(Cards): **Clear a filter with no cards left** — a selected set or value that no longer matches any cards (say after moving them to another collection) vanished from its dropdown yet stayed active. It now stays listed so you can untick it.
- fix(Collection): **Select all respects your filters** — in select mode, "select all" was grabbing every copy in the collection, even cards hidden by your active filters. It now selects only the cards currently shown.
- fix(Collection): **Variant minus no longer reopens the menu** — removing a copy from the variants popover now decrements that variant directly, instead of opening a second, near-identical variants menu.
- fix(Collection): **Friend-group copies no longer inflate your totals** — on the All Cards view, collection stats, and the variant remove popover, copies in your friend groups counted toward your owned numbers, filters, and value. They now count only when you're viewing that group's own collection.

## 2026-06-27

### Highlights

- feat(Cards): **Compact filter bar** — a new optional filter layout (turn it on under Display settings) collapses the filters above the grid into domain and rarity icon toggles plus small dropdowns, so a crowded filter area stays tidy.
- feat(Collection): **Export to Piltover Archive** — the collection export now offers a Piltover Archive CSV format alongside OpenRift's own, so you can move your collection straight into Piltover Archive.
- feat(Trades): **Trade update emails** — you now get an email when the other person accepts, declines, or cancels a trade, batched so a whole basket of cards arrives as one message, with its own toggle under email settings.
- feat(Account): **One-click email unsubscribe** — the native Unsubscribe button in Gmail and Apple Mail now works, and the in-email link opens an on-brand confirmation page.

### Other

- fix(Trades): **Clearer batched trade emails** — batched trade-request and update emails now name the sender on every line, so the trading group is never mistaken for who's trading, and a first batch no longer reads as "N more requests waiting".
- fix(Cards): **Compact "None" on range sliders** — the filter sliders now show a small no-value icon instead of the word "None", so the value labels no longer widen the row.
- fix(App): **Landing page stats load again** — the home page hero counts and card previews were blocked on the live site because the browser requested them from the wrong address, and now load correctly.

## 2026-06-26

### Highlights

- feat(Decks): **Rich deck share previews** — shared deck links now unfurl with a full visual decklist (legend, runes, battlefields, and cards), and you can download a high-resolution version for chats or printing.
- feat(Collection): **Rich previews for shared collections** — a shared collection link now unfurls with a card-art preview when posted to Discord, chat, or social, the same way shared lists already do.

## 2026-06-19

### Highlights

- feat(Trades): **Request copies one at a time** — request individual copies from a member's tradelist, each requested copy shows a "Requested" tag you can click to give back, and requesting more adjusts your existing request instead of erroring.

### Other

- feat(Trades): **Trade requests last a week** — pending trade requests now expire 7 days after they're sent instead of 24 hours, giving you more time to respond.
- feat(Trades): **See what you already own on a tradelist** — browsing a member's tradelist now shows how many of each printing you own next to the Request button, so you can skip cards you already have.
- feat(Trades): **Wishlist hearts on tradelists** — a member's tradelist now flags cards already on your wishlist with a red heart (with how many you want), and clicking it lists every wishlist the card is on so you can open the right one.
- fix(Cards): **Stray filter-panel scroll** — the expanded filter panel no longer has a small leftover scroll on desktop. It now scrolls internally only on short landscape screens, where it is actually needed.
- fix(App): **Cleaner mobile filter bar** — the title, search, and active filters now group with even spacing on phones, and active filters read as lightweight tags (with their category shown inline) instead of a heavy panel.
- fix(Trades): **Wishlist requests stay specific** — requesting a card from a member's tradelist now adds it to a wishlist that matches just that printing, not every printing of the card, and the list picker shows whether each list tracks cards or printings.

## 2026-06-18

### Highlights

- feat(Tournaments): **Enter game points, not places** — score each pod by typing every player's game points (8 wins, more when a turn overshoots), and the finishing order and standings points are worked out for you. Total game points now break ties in the standings.
- feat(Groups): **Take cards from a group bulk box** — browse a group collection and move copies into your inbox with the Take button on each card. A confirmation lets you choose how many copies to take. Cards on your wishlist show a red heart with how many you still want. Click it to jump to that wishlist, and after taking one you wanted, you're asked whether to drop it from the list.

### Other

- feat(Collection): **Choose how many copies to add to a list** — adding a card to a trade or organize list from its menu now lets you pick how many of your copies to add, instead of always adding them all.
- feat(Trades): **Choose your trade email frequency** — get trade-request emails instantly or batched every 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes from your notification settings.
- feat(Groups): **QR code for the join link** — admins can show a scannable QR of the group invite link, handy for inviting people in person.
- feat(Tournaments): **Past events tucked away** — a group's events page now leads with upcoming events and folds past and archived ones into a collapsible "Past and archived" section
- feat(Tournaments): **Deck-check API keys moved to Manage** — a group's deck-check API keys now live on the Manage page with the other admin settings.
- feat(Tournaments): **Set what a sat-out game is worth** — a tournament setting controls the points a bye scores, from the usual win-equivalent down to 0 when sitting out means a player dropped or was not back in time.
- fix(App): **Page titles line up with content** — the title row on pages like Groups and Collection no longer sits indented from the cards below it, and the menu and avatar in the top bar line up with the content too. The misalignment was most obvious on phones held in landscape.
- fix(Collection): **Only your own cards on trade and wishlists** — cards from a group's shared collection aren't yours to trade away, so trade and wish lists no longer accept them. Dragging or adding such a card now skips those lists with a clear note instead of the old, confusing "already on the list" message, and the list isn't offered as a target in the first place. Organize lists still take shared group cards.
- fix(App): **Clear the notch in landscape** — on the installed iPhone app held sideways, sidebar pages and the match tracker no longer slip under the Dynamic Island or home indicator, so the layout stops looking shifted to one side.
- fix(Collection): **Card preview in the quick-add picker on phones** — expanding a card in the quick-add picker now shows its image at the top of the sheet, instead of no preview at all as on desktop.
- fix(Cards): **Filters scroll on landscape phones** — the filter panel held sideways no longer fills the whole screen with no way to scroll. It now scrolls inside so every section stays reachable.
- fix(Groups): **Compact share-lists rows** — each list under "Share your lists" now keeps its name and tags on one line, wrapping only when it has to.
- fix(Groups): **Alphabetical member and trade lists** — the members roster sorts by role then name instead of join date, and a member's possible trades are ordered by card name.
- fix(Groups): **Group list on mobile** — each group on the groups list now stacks on small screens, so a long group name wraps in full instead of being cut off, with the member count and badges dropping to a line below
