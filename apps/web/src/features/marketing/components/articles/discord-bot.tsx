        for any card and it replies with the card image, current prices, and a link to the full card

          Cards that aren&apos;t in the catalog yet are listed at the end of the decklist instead of
          being dropped silently. If the code doesn&apos;t decode, only you see the reply, so a typo
          never clutters the channel.

          The reply quotes the rule together with its sub-rules and links straight to that spot in
          the rules on OpenRift, so settling a mid-game dispute takes one message. Rules also work
          inline: mention <InlineCode>[[CR 103.1]]</InlineCode> or just{" "}
          <InlineCode>[[103.1]]</InlineCode> in a normal message and the bot quotes the rule, same
          as with cards.

      <section>
        <Heading className="mb-2">Mention cards in chat</Heading>

          Wrap a card name in double square brackets anywhere in a normal message, like{" "}
          <InlineCode>[[Doran&apos;s Shield]]</InlineCode>, and the bot replies with the card. Up to
          three cards per message, and a card number like <InlineCode>[[OGN-202]]</InlineCode> shows
          that exact printing. Names the bot doesn&apos;t recognize are simply ignored, so it never
          interrupts a conversation with error messages.
