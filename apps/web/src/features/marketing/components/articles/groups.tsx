        at, and see matches when one member&apos;s wants overlap with another&apos;s haves.

            Joining a group always requires an admin to approve. Nobody can see your lists by
            joining anonymously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharing a list with a group is per-list and per-group. Sharing your wishlist with
            &quot;Tuesday Crew&quot; doesn&apos;t share it with &quot;Cube Night&quot;, and
            unsharing later only affects that one group. The list itself never leaves your account,
            only the contents become visible to the members of that one group.

          A group collection is a pooled inventory that any member of the group can add to or remove
          from. It&apos;s useful for a club cube, a draft pool, or a binder you run together with
          friends.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
          Group collections appear in your own collection sidebar alongside your private
          collections, with a group badge so you can tell them apart. They behave the same way as
          any other collection: cards can be moved in and out, filtered, searched, and printed as
          proxies. See <TextLink href="/help/collections">Managing Your Collection</TextLink> for
          the details.

      <section>
        <Heading className="mb-2">Personal collections</Heading>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          You can also let group members peek at one of your own personal binders without giving up
          control. Open a collection&apos;s share dialog and tick the groups you want to share it
          with under <strong className="text-foreground">Share with friend groups</strong>. Members
          see a read-only view of the cards, just like an anonymous share link, but only while
          they&apos;re signed in and a member of the group.

          your name on the Members and Trades pages, visible only to that group&apos;s members, so
