        The Stage puts Riftbound cards in front of an audience. It has two outputs: a full-screen
        show you run on this screen and capture as a window, and a transparent overlay you paste
        into OBS as a browser source. Both are driven from the same card queue, so you can pick a
        card once and decide later where it appears.
