          organization, keys live on the organization&apos;s page instead and can be managed by its
          owners and managers. A push must use a key that belongs to the tournament&apos;s host: a
          personal key cannot push into an organization&apos;s tournament, and the other way around.

          organization. You can rename keys, see when each was last used, and revoke one at any
          time. A revoked key stops working immediately.

        <Heading className="mb-2">What a push changes</Heading>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          Pushes are partial: only the entries you send are touched, and leaving a player out of a
          push never withdraws them. Withdrawing is always the explicit <Code>withdrawn</Code> flag.
          That makes pushes safe to repeat: re-sending an unchanged entry does nothing, so you can
          push on every registration event without bookkeeping.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
          When a re-pushed entry&apos;s card list actually changed, the stored deck is replaced. If
          a judge had already checked that deck, the check is reset and the judge sees exactly which
          cards were added, removed, or changed, so a stale check can never pass a changed deck.
          Your system stays the source of truth for the list: a push also replaces any edits the
          player made in OpenRift in the meantime.

          <Code>entryId</Code> is the stable OpenRift id for the entry. <Code>claimUrl</Code> is a
          personal link for that player: put it in your confirmation email. A player who opens it
          signs in (or creates an account), confirms, and from then on sees their own submitted deck
          in OpenRift, and only their own. Nothing about the deck or the player is visible before
          the claim is confirmed, and OpenRift never needs the player&apos;s email address for this.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
          The link is stable: re-pushing the same entry returns the same URL, so it is safe to
          re-send in a follow-up email. If a link ever reaches the wrong person, a judge can unlink
          the entry, which also blocks it from being claimed again.
