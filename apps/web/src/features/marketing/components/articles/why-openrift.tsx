        <div className="text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
          <p>Honestly? I just wanted to track my collection.</p>
          <p>
            I used the existing Riftbound trackers for months, and each one was missing something I
            needed. Eventually I stopped waiting for someone else to build it and built the tool I
            wanted. It has become the app I use every day for my own cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know how that sounds: the world didn&apos;t ask for yet another collection tracker.
            The honest answer to &quot;why not improve an existing one instead?&quot; is that none
            of them are open source, so there was nothing to contribute to. OpenRift is, and it
            imports from and exports to the formats the other tools use, so you can bring your
            collection over in minutes, and take it back out just as easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s not just me, either. My local game store group uses it every day, for example
            to run our shared &quot;bulk box&quot;: a group collection of spare cards where taking a
            card out moves it straight into your own collection. A good part of the{" "}
            <Link to="/roadmap" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              roadmap
            </Link>{" "}
            started as their feature requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fair question to ask any new fan project is whether it will still be around next
            year. I can&apos;t promise the future, but I can point at a track record: the{" "}
            <Link to="/changelog" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              changelog
            </Link>{" "}
            shows what has shipped week by week since launch, my play group depends on the app
            daily, and my own collection lives here too. As long as I play Riftbound, OpenRift gets
            maintained.

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4 mb-2">
          And credit where it&apos;s due: the other tools genuinely do some things better.

        <ul className="text-muted-foreground list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
          <li>
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Piltover Archive</span> has bulk adding of
            cards, a massive library of user and tournament decklists, and by far the biggest
            community.

          <li>
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Riftbound.gg</span> has aggregate
