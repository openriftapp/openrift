      <h2>2. General information on data processing</h2>
      <p>
        We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functioning
        website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes
        place regularly only with the consent of the user. An exception applies in cases where prior
        consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of the data is permitted
        by law.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Legal basis</h2>
      <p>
        Insofar as we obtain consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR serves
        as the legal basis. When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a
        contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
        This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for pre-contractual measures.
        Insofar as processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which
        our company is subject, Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis. If processing is
        necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, and the
        interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former
        interest, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Personal data will be stored only for as long as necessary for the respective purpose. Once
        the purpose no longer applies, the data is routinely blocked or erased in accordance with
        legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Server log files</h2>
