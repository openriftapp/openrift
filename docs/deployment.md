# Deployment

OpenRift runs on a VPS with Docker Compose behind Cloudflare. Two instances share the same host:

- **Stable** (`openrift.app`) — deploys when a release is triggered (from `~/openrift`)
- **Preview** (`preview.openrift.app`) — auto-deploys on every push to `main` (from `~/openrift-preview`)

Docker images are built in GitHub Actions and pushed to GHCR. The VPS only pulls pre-built images — no building on prod, no git clone needed.

A fifth GHCR package, `openrift-buildcache`, holds the BuildKit layer cache with one tag per build target (`main-build-api`, `main-build-web`, `main-build-proxy`, `main-build-bot`). Nothing pulls it at runtime. It replaced the GitHub Actions cache backend, which evicted entries at GitHub's 10 GB per-repository cap and made every build re-run `bun install`, so `latest` and `preview` never shared a dependency layer.

## Architecture

| Container | Image                                | Role                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db`      | `postgres:18-alpine`                 | Database (unchanged across deploys)                                                               |
| `api`     | `ghcr.io/openriftapp/openrift-api`   | API + migrations on startup + cron jobs (Bun)                                                     |
| `web`     | `ghcr.io/openriftapp/openrift-web`   | TanStack Start SSR server (Bun, internal only)                                                    |
| `proxy`   | `ghcr.io/openriftapp/openrift-proxy` | Nginx reverse proxy + static assets (exposed on :8080)                                            |
| `bot`     | `ghcr.io/openriftapp/openrift-bot`   | Discord card-lookup bot (opt-in via `COMPOSE_PROFILES=bot`, see [discord-bot.md](discord-bot.md)) |

The `api` container:

1. Runs database migrations on startup (blocks until complete)
2. Registers whatever job schedules the `job_schedules` table holds; enabling a job happens on `/admin/jobs`, not at startup
3. Starts the Hono API server

## Release Strategy

Development follows a trunk-based model: all work lands on `main` and immediately deploys to the preview instance. When ready to release, trigger the **Release** workflow manually from GitHub Actions (`workflow_dispatch`). It runs [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) to determine the next version from conventional commits, creates a GitHub release with the tag, re-tags the images the preview build already pushed for that commit as `v1.2.3` + `latest`, and deploys to the stable VPS — all in one workflow. Nothing is rebuilt: preview and stable run the same image digest.

### Feature Flags

Incomplete features can be pushed to `main` behind feature flags, tested on preview, and kept hidden on stable until ready. Flags are managed via the admin panel — no rebuild or restart needed. See [feature-flags.md](feature-flags.md) for full details.

## How It Works

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Push to `main`** → `preview.yml` builds all four images (api, web, proxy, bot) tagged `:preview` and `:sha-<commit>`, uploads Sentry source maps, pushes to GHCR, then SSHes to VPS and runs `./deploy.sh`
2. **Manual release** → `release.yml` (triggered via `workflow_dispatch`) waits until the `:sha-<commit>` images for the current `main` commit exist, runs semantic-release to determine the next version, tags those images `:vX.Y.Z` + `:latest` via `docker buildx imagetools create`, then SSHes to VPS and runs `./deploy.sh`. If the preview build for that commit was superseded before it finished, re-run the Preview workflow first.

### Deploy Script

The `deploy.sh` on the VPS is minimal — no git operations, no building:

1. Pulls pre-built images from GHCR (the `IMAGE_TAG` in `.env` controls which tag)
2. Restarts services (migrations run automatically on api startup)
3. Purges the Cloudflare edge cache **targeted**: the anonymous HTML shells (the allowlist in `apps/web/src/lib/page-cache.ts`, see ADR-016) and everything under `/api/` are purged by prefix + the root URL; hashed `/assets/` and `/media/` are deliberately left cached — they're content-addressed and can never be stale, and keeping them warm avoids a multi-second cold load for the first visitors after each release (and keeps lazy-loading working for tabs still on the previous bundle). Uses `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_PURGE_HOST` from `.env`. The API purge matters on releases that change a response schema: without it the edge could serve old-shape payloads for up to the `stale-while-revalidate` window (24h for catalog/init).
4. Cleans up old images (best-effort: prod and preview share the VPS and the Docker daemon allows only one prune at a time, so an overlapping deploy just leaves the old layers for the next run)

Purge prefixes are host-scoped, so prod (`CLOUDFLARE_PURGE_HOST=openrift.app`) and preview (`preview.openrift.app`) can purge independently despite sharing one Cloudflare zone. All purge types (URL, prefix, hostname, tag) are available on the Free plan — prefix/hostname purges are rate-limited to 5 requests/minute, far above deploy frequency. If `CLOUDFLARE_PURGE_HOST` is missing the script falls back to `purge_everything`; if the credentials are missing it skips purging entirely (preview ran without credentials until the host-scoped purge made it safe — without any purge, preview can serve a stale HTML shell for up to ~1h after a deploy).

The full-cache nuke remains available as the admin UI's cache purge button (`purge_everything`).

### Startup Sequence

When the `api` container starts:

1. **Migrations** run to completion (blocks startup)
2. **Cron jobs** register for price refresh (non-blocking timers)
3. **Hono server** starts listening on port 3000

#### Ordering across containers

`docker-compose.yml` gates `web` and `bot` on `api` with `condition: service_healthy`, so a deploy never starts the SSR server against an API that is still migrating.

That condition is only evaluated by `docker compose up`. When the **daemon** starts containers on its own (a host reboot, `systemctl restart docker`, or a `restart: unless-stopped` policy firing after a crash) it follows the restart policy and ignores dependency order. The SSR server then comes up next to a still-migrating API and throws connect errors on its first requests, which is what happened after a host reboot.

So the `web` and `bot` images also carry an in-container gate, `scripts/wait-for-api.sh`, wired as their `ENTRYPOINT`. It polls `${API_INTERNAL_URL}/api/health` and only then `exec`s the real command, so the app inherits the entrypoint's process and no supervisor sits between it and its signals. It runs on every container start, so it covers the daemon-driven cases compose cannot.

Both services also set `init: true`, which puts tini at PID 1. The probe wraps each `wget` in busybox `timeout`, and busybox's applet is the inverse of the coreutils one: it double-forks a watchdog and then `exec`s the command itself, so the watchdog is orphaned onto PID 1. The last probe's watchdog outlives the `exec`, and bun does not reap adopted orphans, which left one `[timeout] <defunct>` per container start. tini reaps it and forwards `SIGTERM` to the app, so `stop_grace_period` and graceful shutdown are unaffected.

The gate **fails open**: after `API_WAIT_TIMEOUT` it starts anyway rather than parking the site in maintenance indefinitely. A permanently unhealthy API is a separate incident, and while the SSR server is not listening nginx already serves `maintenance.html` (the `@maintenance` fallback in `nginx/web.conf`).

| Variable                 | Default                 | Description                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `API_WAIT_TIMEOUT`       | `120`                   | Total seconds to wait before giving up |
| `API_WAIT_INTERVAL`      | `2`                     | Seconds between probes                 |
| `API_WAIT_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | `3`                     | Per-probe timeout                      |
| `API_HEALTH_URL`         | from `API_INTERNAL_URL` | Overrides the probed URL outright      |

`web`'s healthcheck carries `start_period: 150s` to cover the wait plus SSR boot; without it a slow API would get the container marked unhealthy while the gate is doing its job.

### Shutdown

Every container exits on its own within its stop timeout, so a deploy never waits for Docker to kill one.

- **api** stops its job timers, stops accepting connections, gives in-flight requests 5 s, then closes the render workers and the database pool, flushes Sentry and traces, and exits. A deadline exits it after 8 s whatever is still pending. A job cut short stays `running` until the next start marks it failed. The service runs with `init: true`: as PID 1, Bun ignores any signal it has no handler for, which includes SIGTERM during the startup migrations.
- **web** closes through srvx, which waits up to 5 s for in-flight requests but never exits the process. The Nitro plugin `apps/web/nitro/exit-on-close.ts` flushes Sentry and traces on Nitro's `close` hook and exits.
- **proxy** caps nginx's graceful stop at 5 s with `worker_shutdown_timeout`, set on the image's command line.

## Environment Variables

### Other Configuration

| Variable      | Default  | Description                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `IMAGE_TAG`   | `latest` | GHCR image tag (`preview`, `latest`, or `v1.2.3`) |
| `SMTP_PORT`   | `465`    | SMTP port for email verification                  |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `true`   | Use TLS for SMTP                                  |

Job schedules (price refreshes, changelog post, meta syncs, trade digest) are managed on `/admin/jobs`, not through env vars. See [settings.md](settings.md#scheduled-jobs).

## Regular Deploys

Deploys are fully automated via GitHub Actions. For manual intervention:

```bash
# Pull latest images and restart
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Or use the deploy script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The first deploy of the release that introduced `job_schedules` (job scheduling moved out of `CRON_*` env vars) needs schedules enabled once on `/admin/jobs`; every deploy after that keeps whatever is in the table.

## Common Operations

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f api

# Access the database
docker compose exec db psql -U openrift -d openrift

# Restart a single service
docker compose restart api

# Manually trigger price refresh (via admin API)
curl -X POST -H "Cookie: ..." https://openrift.app/api/admin/refresh-tcgplayer-prices
curl -X POST -H "Cookie: ..." https://openrift.app/api/admin/refresh-cardmarket-prices

# Stop everything
docker compose down              # Keeps data (bind-mounted in ./data/)
docker compose down -v           # Same as above — bind mounts are NOT deleted by -v
```

## Disk usage

The VPS root disk is 40 GB. A 30 GB Hetzner volume (ext4, mounted at `/mnt/HC_Volume_<id>`) holds the monitoring data and the preview instance, bind-mounted back to their original paths through `/etc/fstab`:

```
/mnt/HC_Volume_<id>/monitoring-data  /home/openrift/openrift/monitoring/data  none  bind,nofail,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/mnt/HC_Volume_<id>  0 0
/mnt/HC_Volume_<id>/openrift-preview /home/openrift/openrift-preview          none  bind,nofail,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/mnt/HC_Volume_<id>  0 0
```

Compose files and paths are unchanged. Prod Postgres and prod media stay on the root disk. If the volume is missing at boot, the empty root-owned mount points stop the containers from writing to the root disk.

Prometheus holds the history for free space (`node_filesystem_avail_bytes`, graphed on the Infrastructure dashboard), the telemetry stores (`telemetry_disk_usage_bytes`, on the Telemetry pipeline dashboard), the prod database (`pg_database_size_bytes`) and its tables (`pg_stat_user_tables_table_size_bytes`, `pg_stat_user_tables_index_size_bytes`). For everything else (Docker images, container logs, the preview database, journald), `scripts/disk-report.sh` prints a breakdown on the VPS:

```bash
scp scripts/disk-report.sh openrift@VPS:~/openrift/disk-report.sh
sudo bash /home/openrift/openrift/disk-report.sh
```

Run it as root. As openrift it skips the container logs and system sections and limits the directory listing to `$HOME`.

## Known issues

### postgres.js queries hang after a dropped connection

postgres.js 3.4.9 (latest release as of 2026-09) has an unguarded `socket.write` in `nextWrite` (`src/connection.js`). When a database connection closes while a write for it is still queued, the write throws `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'socket.write')`. The query that hit it never settles, and later queries routed to that connection hang the same way. The rest of the pool keeps working.

The trigger we have reproduced is a backend connection closing while the API event loop is blocked. On 2026-09-15 a 45 s synchronous job (check matching, since made non-blocking) overlapped with one API connection closing. The shared version check in `createContentAddressedCache` landed on the broken connection, so every `enums.all()` caller hung until the API was restarted.

**Symptoms**

- Some API endpoints never answer while others do. On 2026-09-15: `/api/v1/init` and the decks list hung, `/api/v1/catalog` answered.
- Card, promo and meta pages return 503 after about 10 s, and the web logs show `The connection was closed.`
- No API error log, no trace in Tempo for the hung requests, and Postgres shows no active query for them. The `TypeError` may not appear in the logs either.

**Recover**

Restart the API: `docker compose restart api`. The broken state lives only in process memory.

**Permanent fix, if it happens again**

Apply the guard from [porsager/postgres#1209](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/pull/1209) with `bun patch`. It rejects the queued queries with `CONNECTION_CLOSED` instead of throwing, and the pool reconnects. Run `bun patch postgres@3.4.9` from the repo root, edit `src/connection.js` in the directory it prints, then `bun patch --commit` that directory. The API runs the `bun` export, which is `src/`; `cjs/`, `cf/` and `deno/` need no change.

```js
function nextWrite(fn) {
  if (!socket) {
    nextWriteTimer !== null && clearImmediate(nextWriteTimer);
    chunk = nextWriteTimer = null;
    error(Errors.connection("CONNECTION_CLOSED", options, socket));
    return false;
  }
  const x = socket.write(chunk, fn);
  nextWriteTimer !== null && clearImmediate(nextWriteTimer);
  chunk = nextWriteTimer = null;
  return x;
}
```

This guard was tested against a local reproduction (Bun 1.4.2, postgres.js 3.4.9, PostgreSQL 18.6): with one connection terminated via `pg_terminate_backend` during a 45 s event-loop block, unpatched postgres.js left 3 of 50 later queries hanging; patched, those queries failed with `CONNECTION_CLOSED` and nothing hung. The guards in [#1168](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/pull/1168) and [#1176](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/pull/1176) only return `false`, which avoids the crash but leaves the queries hanging.

Remove the patch, and the comments pointing here from `apps/api/src/db/connect.ts` and `catalog-assembly.ts`, once a postgres.js release contains the fix.

Upstream: [#1066](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/1066), [#1154](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/1154), [#1208](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/1208), [#1186](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/1186) (the same class of hang inside transactions).

## Database Backups

The backup container runs `pg_dump` on a schedule and uploads GPG-encrypted backups to Cloudflare R2. It uses the [siemens/postgres-backup-s3](https://github.com/siemens/postgres-backup-s3) image (`:18` tag matches our PostgreSQL version). Old backups are automatically pruned after `BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS`.

It runs as a separate Docker Compose project in `backup/`, connecting to the main app's network to reach the database.

### Configuration

Create `backup/.env` from `backup/.env.example` and fill in the values. The backup stack has its own `.env` (separate from the main app), including duplicated Postgres credentials. See `backup/.env.example` for all variables.

### Manual backup

Run a one-off backup (dumps immediately, then exits):

```bash
cd backup && docker compose run --rm -e SCHEDULE= backup
```

### Restore from backup

Download the `.dump.gpg` file from R2 (use the Cloudflare dashboard, rclone, or aws cli), then decrypt and restore. On Windows, `gpg` is included with Git for Windows — use Git Bash. Otherwise install [GPG4Win](https://gpg4win.org/).

```bash
# Decrypt
gpg --decrypt --batch --passphrase "your-passphrase" openrift_2026-03-06T03:00:00.dump.gpg > openrift.dump

# Restore into the running database
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U openrift -d openrift --clean --if-exists < openrift.dump
```

### Setup (first time)

1. Create an R2 bucket (e.g. `openrift-backups`) in the Cloudflare dashboard (R2 → Create bucket, EU region)
2. Create an R2 API token: R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens → Object Read & Write, scoped to the backup bucket only
3. Generate an encryption passphrase: `openssl rand -base64 32` — save it in a password manager
4. Create `backup/.env` from `backup/.env.example` and fill in the R2 credentials, encryption passphrase, and Postgres credentials
5. Start the backup container: `cd backup && docker compose up -d`
6. Verify with a one-off backup: `cd backup && docker compose run --rm -e SCHEDULE= backup` — check the R2 bucket for the uploaded file

## Logs

All services write to stdout/stderr and Docker captures the output. There is no dedicated logging library — the API uses `console.log()`, the web container uses nginx's default access/error logs, and PostgreSQL writes its own logs.

### Viewing logs

```bash
# All services (follow mode)
docker compose logs -f

# Single service
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f web
docker compose logs -f db

# Last 200 lines
docker compose logs --tail 200 api

# Since a specific time
docker compose logs --since "2025-01-15T10:00:00" api
```

### Where logs are stored

| Source                          | Location                                                | Notes                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **API** (`api` container)       | Docker json-file log                                    | API + migration + cron output |
| **Web / SSR** (`web` container) | Docker json-file log                                    | SSR server output             |
| **Proxy / nginx** (`proxy`)     | Docker json-file log                                    | nginx access + error logs     |
| **PostgreSQL** (`db` container) | Docker json-file log                                    | Postgres server logs          |
| **Host nginx**                  | `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, `/var/log/nginx/error.log` | TLS-terminating reverse proxy |

Docker stores container logs under `/var/lib/docker/containers/<id>/<id>-json.log`. You rarely need to access these files directly — use `docker compose logs` instead.

### Log rotation

**Docker container logs** use Docker's default `json-file` driver, which does **not** rotate by default. On a long-running VPS, logs can grow unbounded. To enable rotation, add this to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and restart Docker (`systemctl restart docker`):

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "20m",
    "max-file": "5"
  }
}
```

This caps each container's log at 5 × 20 MB (100 MB total per container). Existing containers need to be recreated (`docker compose up -d --force-recreate`) to pick up the new settings.

**Host nginx logs** (`/var/log/nginx/`) are rotated daily by the system's logrotate. `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx` on the VPS is set to `rotate 7` (Ubuntu's default is 14) to save disk.

### Health checks

**API** (`/api/health`) returns:

- `200 { "status": "ok" }` — healthy
- `503 { "status": "db_unreachable" }` — can't connect to PostgreSQL
- `503 { "status": "db_empty" }` — connected but no data
- `503 { "status": "db_not_migrated" }` — migrations haven't run

**Web SSR** (`/health`) returns `200 ok` (plain text). This is handled in `server.ts` before the router, so it doesn't render React.

```bash
# Production (through proxy)
curl -s localhost:8080/api/health | jq .
curl -s localhost:8080/health

# Local dev
curl -s localhost:3000/api/health | jq .
```

## Price Refresh

Price refresh runs via in-process cron jobs in the `api` container, on whatever schedule the `job_schedules` table holds; each job is off until an admin enables it on `/admin/jobs`. The `protect: true` option prevents overlapping runs.

**Run manually via admin API:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Cookie: ..." https://openrift.app/api/admin/refresh-tcgplayer-prices
curl -X POST -H "Cookie: ..." https://openrift.app/api/admin/refresh-cardmarket-prices
```

**Logs:** Cron output goes to the `api` container's stdout, visible via `docker compose logs api`.

The script is idempotent: re-running with the same source data updates existing snapshots (ON CONFLICT on `product_id + recorded_at`) rather than creating duplicates.

## First-Time VPS Setup

### 1. Install Docker

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

Verify with `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.

### 2. Create the `openrift` user

```bash
adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" openrift
usermod -aG docker openrift
```

This user owns the app and can run Docker commands, but has no root privileges.

### 3. Authenticate with GHCR

The VPS needs to pull images from GHCR. Create a GitHub PAT with `read:packages` scope:

```bash
su - openrift
echo "$PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u eikowagenknecht --password-stdin
```

Docker stores the credential in `~/.docker/config.json`. This only needs to be done once (or when the PAT is rotated).

### 4. Set up SSH access for GitHub Actions

On your **local machine**, generate a key for CI deploys:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/openrift-deploy -C "openrift-deploy" -N ""
cat ~/.ssh/openrift-deploy.pub
```

On the **server** (as root), add it to the `openrift` user's authorized keys:

```bash
echo "paste-the-public-key-here" >> /home/openrift/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown openrift:openrift /home/openrift/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Add these as **repository secrets** in GitHub (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

| Secret        | Value                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `VPS_HOST`    | Server IP address                                  |
| `VPS_USER`    | `openrift`                                         |
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Contents of `~/.ssh/openrift-deploy` (private key) |

### 5. Copy files to the VPS

Each instance needs only three files: `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and `deploy.sh`. No git clone required.

```bash
su - openrift
mkdir -p ~/openrift ~/openrift-preview
```

From your **local machine**, copy the files:

```bash
# Stable instance
scp docker-compose.yml openrift@VPS:~/openrift/
scp deploy.sh.example openrift@VPS:~/openrift/deploy.sh
scp -r backup openrift@VPS:~/openrift/backup

# Preview instance
scp docker-compose.yml openrift@VPS:~/openrift-preview/
scp deploy.sh.example openrift@VPS:~/openrift-preview/deploy.sh
scp -r backup openrift@VPS:~/openrift-preview/backup
```

On the **server**:

```bash
chmod +x ~/openrift/deploy.sh ~/openrift-preview/deploy.sh
```

Create `.env` for each instance from `.env.example`:

```bash
# Stable: use default ports (5432/3001/8080), set IMAGE_TAG=latest
# Preview: use preview ports (DB_PORT=5433, API_PORT=3002, WEB_PORT=8081), set IMAGE_TAG=preview
```

Note: `DATABASE_URL` host must be `db` (the Docker Compose service name), not `localhost`.

### 6. Set up TLS with Cloudflare

OpenRift uses Cloudflare as a reverse proxy (orange cloud / proxied DNS). TLS between Cloudflare and the VPS is terminated by host nginx using a Cloudflare Origin Certificate.

**DNS:** Create A records (proxied) for `openrift.app` and `preview.openrift.app` pointing to the VPS IP. Set Cloudflare SSL/TLS mode to **Full (strict)**.

**Origin Certificates:** In the Cloudflare dashboard (SSL/TLS → Origin Server), generate certificates for each domain:

```bash
# Stable
mkdir -p ~/openrift/certs
# Paste certificate → certs/origin.pem, private key → certs/origin-key.pem

# Preview
mkdir -p ~/openrift-preview/certs
# Paste certificate → certs/origin.pem, private key → certs/origin-key.pem
```

**Host nginx:** Install nginx and copy the config files from the repo:

```bash
apt install -y nginx

# Copy nginx configs from the repo to the VPS
scp nginx/openrift.conf openrift@VPS:~/openrift/
scp nginx/preview.openrift.conf openrift@VPS:~/openrift-preview/

# Files the configs reference via absolute paths (maintenance page,
# Cloudflare real-IP ranges). The VPS has no git checkout, so re-run these
# scp commands whenever one of the files changes in the repo.
ssh openrift@VPS 'mkdir -p ~/openrift/nginx ~/openrift-preview/nginx'
scp nginx/maintenance.html nginx/cloudflare-realip.conf openrift@VPS:~/openrift/nginx/
scp nginx/maintenance.html nginx/cloudflare-realip.conf openrift@VPS:~/openrift-preview/nginx/

# On the server, symlink them
ln -s /home/openrift/openrift/openrift.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/openrift.app
ln -s /home/openrift/openrift-preview/preview.openrift.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/preview.openrift.app
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

`openrift.conf` proxies `openrift.app` → `:8080`, `preview.openrift.conf` proxies `preview.openrift.app` → `:8081`.

**Security invariant — `X-Real-IP` must be overwritten here.** The API's
sign-in/sign-up brute-force limiter and the proxy container's `limit_req`
zone both key on `X-Real-IP`, and the proxy container _trusts_ the incoming
header (it can't know the real client address behind host nginx). The host
configs in the repo do this correctly: the Cloudflare `real_ip` include maps
`$remote_addr` to the visitor IP, and every `proxy_pass` block sets
`proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`, which overwrites anything a
client sent. After changing or re-copying a host nginx config, verify the
deployed file still carries that line for every location that proxies to
`:8080`/`:8081` — without it, clients can spoof `X-Real-IP` and bypass or
poison the rate limits.

### 7. First deploy

```bash
su - openrift

# Stable
cd ~/openrift && ./deploy.sh
# Refresh catalog on first deploy (via admin API)

# Preview
cd ~/openrift-preview && ./deploy.sh
```

A new stack starts with every job disabled; enable schedules once on `/admin/jobs` ("Enable all suggested" covers the normal case).

Verify:

```bash
# Stable
cd ~/openrift && docker compose ps
curl -s localhost:8080/health    # Should return "ok" (SSR server via proxy)
curl -s localhost:8080/api/health | jq .

# Preview
cd ~/openrift-preview && docker compose ps
curl -s localhost:8081/health    # Should return "ok"
curl -s localhost:8081/api/health | jq .
```

## Monitoring

An optional Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack lives in `monitoring/`. It runs as a separate Docker Compose project alongside the main app.

### What it monitors

- **Host metrics** (CPU, RAM, disk, network) via node-exporter
- **Container metrics** (per-container CPU, memory, restarts) via cAdvisor
- **PostgreSQL metrics** (connections, transactions, cache hit ratio, deadlocks) via postgres-exporter
- **Traces** from the API and SSR via Tempo, with span-derived RED metrics fed back into Prometheus as exemplars
- **Logs** from all app and monitoring containers via Loki, with `trace_id` attached as structured metadata for Tempo ↔ Loki pivots
- **Alerting** via Grafana (email notifications for high RAM, disk, CPU, container restarts, DB connection saturation)

### Telemetry pipeline

```text
  apps ──OTLP──▶ Alloy ──▶ Tempo      (traces)
                  │
                  └─tail Docker logs──▶ Loki   (logs, with trace_id)

  apps ──/metrics──▶ Prometheus              (metrics, with exemplars)

  apps ──errors────▶ Sentry                  (with trace_id tag and context)
```

Alloy is the single entrypoint for app telemetry: apps export OTLP to `http://alloy:4318` (Docker) or `http://localhost:4318` (host dev). Alloy forwards traces to Tempo and tails Docker container stdout, parsing pino JSON to lift `trace_id`, `service`, and `level` for Loki. In Grafana, a span in Tempo links to its log lines in Loki; a Sentry issue carries the `trace_id` tag for the same pivot.

### Setup

1. Copy the `monitoring/` directory to the VPS:

```bash
scp -r monitoring openrift@VPS:~/openrift/monitoring
```

2. Create `.env` from the template:

```bash
cd ~/openrift/monitoring
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD, SMTP credentials, POSTGRES_CONNECTION
```

3. Create data directories (must exist before first start):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/openrift/monitoring/data/{prometheus,grafana,tempo,loki,alloy}
```

4. Start the monitoring stack:

```bash
cd ~/openrift/monitoring
docker compose up -d
```

5. Set up Grafana access via nginx (optional, for browser access):

```bash
# Generate basic auth credentials
apt install -y apache2-utils
htpasswd -c /home/openrift/openrift/certs/.htpasswd admin

# Symlink nginx config and enable it
ln -s /home/openrift/openrift/monitoring.openrift.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/monitoring.openrift.app
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

6. Add a DNS record in Cloudflare: `monitoring.openrift.app` (A record, proxied, same IP as main site).

7. Open `https://monitoring.openrift.app`, log in with the basic auth credentials, then with the Grafana admin password. Three dashboards are pre-provisioned: Host Metrics, Container Metrics, and PostgreSQL.

8. Set up email alerting: go to Alerting > Contact points, add an email contact point with your alert recipient address. Then create alert rules under Alerting > Alert rules (or import them). Send a test notification to verify SMTP works.

### Management

```bash
cd ~/openrift/monitoring

# View status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f grafana
docker compose logs -f prometheus

# Restart
docker compose restart

# Stop (preserves data)
docker compose down

# Stop and delete all data (dashboards, metrics history)
docker compose down -v
```

### Storage

Prometheus retains metrics for 90 days by default (configurable via `PROMETHEUS_RETENTION` in `.env`). Estimated disk usage:

| Retention | Storage   |
| --------- | --------- |
| 30 days   | ~0.5-1 GB |
| 90 days   | ~1.5-3 GB |
| 180 days  | ~3-6 GB   |
| 1 year    | ~6-12 GB  |
